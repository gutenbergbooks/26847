<h1>A PESSIMIST.</h1>

<h3><a name="Wisdom_in_the_Woods" id="Wisdom_in_the_Woods"></a>I.</h3>

<h4>WISDOM IN THE WOODS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> seen and heard little of Hartman
since our college days. There he was counted
a youth of eminent promise: after that I
knew that he had traveled, written something
or other, and practised law&mdash;or professed it, and
not too eagerly: then he had disappeared.
Last May I stumbled on him in a secluded
region where I had gone to fish and rest,
after a year of too close attention to business.
We came face to face in the woods, stared
at each other, and then our hands met
in the old grip. He took me home with
him, to a comfortable enough bachelor establishment,
and we made a night&mdash;or more than
an evening&mdash;of it. He did not seem curious,
but I was.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing with yourself!"
I began; "withdrawing from the
world?"</p>

<p>"To some extent," he said. "You can't do
that entirely, you know. The world is in you
as well as around you, unluckily. It is too
much with us, as the poet observed. Do you
remember the time you had in class over that
sonnet?"</p>

<p>"Pass that," I said. "I've given up
poetry." ("I should have thought that impossible,"
he put in, in his nasty nagging fashion;
but I took no notice.) "Where have you
been all the time?"</p>

<p>"Here, mostly. It's not much of a place,
but that is its merit."</p>

<p>He was getting too deep now, as he often
did of old; so I <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'said.' with a period">said,</ins> "But it's so far away."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
"That's its other merit. You always had
a direct and ingenuous mind, Bob. Here
you've hit both bull's-eyes in two shots."</p>

<p>"None of your chaff," said I. "Who do
you practice your wits on, up here?"</p>

<p>"My dogs. And there are some hens in
the neighborhood, and a few small farmers.
Or if my bosom cries too loudly to be eased of
its perilous stuff, I can chaff myself, which
is more profitable."</p>

<p>"You were always too clever for me. What
else do you do?"</p>

<p>"As the Baroness used to say in <i>The Danicheffs</i>,
in our days of vanity, 'Do you think
that is much of a compliment?' I read, and
fish, and climb, and ride several hobbies, and
meditate on Man, on Nature, and on Human
Fate."</p>

<p>"What's the good of that?" I was growing
impatient of all this nonsense.</p>

<p>"Well, not much, perhaps," said he. "For
you, very little indeed. But intrinsically it
is about as profitable as more popular avocations."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Hartman," I said. "You're
a better man any day than I&mdash;or you were.
But here you are, hidden in the backwoods
with owls (one of them was making a horrid
noise outside), and nothing to show. Now
I've got a wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And seven children," he interposed.</p>

<p>"No, only three. But I have a good business,
and a house on the avenue, and a decent
social position, and I'm making money. And
I don't like to see you throw yourself away
like this."</p>

<p>"Old man," said Hartman, "we are just of
an age, and you would pass for five years the
elder. Your hair is getting gray, and thin on
top. You look fagged. And you owned to
me that you came here to pick up."</p>

<p>He had me there a little. "Yes, I've been
working hard. But I'm in the swim. I do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as others do. I help to make the wheels go
round." I thought I had him there; but you
never can count on Hartman, except for an
answer of some kind.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they go round without your
help? And why should they go around,
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads anyway?&quot; with a quotation mark">anyway?</ins> It might be a variety to have
them stop. What's the good of it?"</p>

<p>I stared at him; but his eye looked more
rational than his talk sounded. "The good
of it is that I am in things generally, while
you are out."</p>

<p>"Exactly so. I am out, while you are in.
As to things generally, I prefer to be with the
outs. It is a matter of taste, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Well, you are beyond me. But I brought
myself in merely as an example&mdash;not that I
set up to be much of that&mdash;or an illustration,
say. I want to know about you." It may have
been foolish, but somehow I felt the old affection
coming back as we talked. "What does
it all mean, Harty?"</p>

<p>He looked at me. "Do you really want to
know, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Do you suppose I've forgotten
the larks we used to have, and the
scrapes you got me out of, and how you coached
me through that exam, in Calculus? It's
long ago, Jim; but I took it rather hard, the
way you dropped me."</p>

<p>He began to look as he used to: he wasn't a
selfish fellow in those days. "I never meant
to be hard on you, Bob, nor supposed you'd
take it so: and I doubt if you did, though you
think so at this moment. It was part of a
system; and systems are poor things, though
we can't do without them. I'll tell you how
it was."</p>

<p>"Wait till I fill up.&mdash;Now go ahead."</p>

<p>"You don't smoke as you used to, Bob.
Does the Madam object?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't like tobacco about the house,
of course. And I'm not sure it's good for me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
"Ah. Sorry to be leading you astray.
There is no one to interfere with my little
vices. Well, Bob, I got tired of it. Not that
that alone would matter: one could stand
being bored in a good cause. But I couldn't
see that it was a good cause."</p>

<p>"Would you mind <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads explaining? with no quotation mark">explaining?"</ins> said I.
"What cause?"</p>

<p>"Helping to make the wheels go round.
Being in the swim. Doing as others do. Trying
to make a little money and a little name,
and following the fashions of a carnal-minded
generation. I could see no point to it, Bob;
the game never seemed worth the candle."</p>

<p>"And so you came out in the woods, like
what's his name&mdash;that Concord fellow. Do
you find this any better?"</p>

<p>"Negatively. I am not so much a part of
the things I despise. The pomps and vanities
are conspicuous chiefly by their absence. It
is a simpler life, comparatively laudable for
there being less of it."</p>

<p>"And don't you get bored, out here? A
week or so of it is well enough in a way; but
take it the year round, I should think you'd
find it worse than civilization."</p>

<p>"I get bored, of course: that is incidental
to life, and chronic with one who has looked
beneath the surface and sifted values. But
it's not so oppressive as in town. There are
no shams here, to speak of. Having no business
and no society, we don't pretend to be
very different from what we are."</p>

<p>"O, if you come to that, the women still
improve on nature, and the street has its little
tricks and methods; but you could keep out of
them. You were in the law."</p>

<p>"It's all the same, Bob. The law now is
worked much more as a business than as a
science. Look at Jones, and Brown, and
Jenkins: they are getting on, I hear. I don't
want to get on in that way."</p>

<p>"But you might have taken the scientific
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
side of it. With your head piece, and your
high and mighty notions, there was a field for
you."</p>

<p>"So is theology a field, or physic, or Greek
roots, or chiropody&mdash;for him, who believes in
them. I was not able to see that one line of
thought has a right to crowd out all the rest,
or to sink my whole soul in a profession.
That's what they want of you now&mdash;to make
a little clearing, and put up palings all round
it, and see things outside only through the
chinks of your blessed fence. Be a narrow
specialist: know one thing, and care for nothing
else. I suppose you can do that with oil."</p>

<p>I thought there was some uncalled-for bitterness
in this; but the poor fellow can't be
contented, with his lonesome and aimless life.
"We're not talking about me, Jim. You're
the topic. Stick to your text, and preach
away: my soul is not so immersed in oil that
I can't listen. But I don't blame you for
going back on the law; a beast of a business,
I always thought it. Why didn't you go for
a Professorship?"</p>

<p>"My poor friend, you were at college four
years, and graduated&mdash;without honors, it is
true. Don't you remember how little we
cared for the Profs. and their eminent attainments?
We took it for granted that it was all
right, and they understood what they were at;
but it was a grind, to them and to us. If a
man was an enthusiast for his branch, we
rather laughed at him; or if his name was well
up, we were willing to be proud of him&mdash;at a
distance&mdash;as an honor to Alma Mater; but we
kicked all the same, if he tried to put extra
work on us. It was all fashion, routine, tradition.
The student mind doesn't begin to
look into things for itself till about the senior
year, and then it's full of what lies ahead, in
the great world outside&mdash;poor innocents! With
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'these'">those</ins> of us who had anything in us, it took
most of the time to knock the nonsense out.&mdash;And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
then if a man wants a chair, he must
take it in a western concern, where he'll be
expected to lead in prayer-meeting, and to
have no views of geology that conflict with the
Catechism."</p>

<p>"Well then, why not go on with literature?
That was in your line: you might have made
a good thing of it."</p>

<p>"Yes, by 'unremitting application,' much
the same as at law, and taking it seriously as
a profession, I might in time possibly have
made five hundred a year off the magazines,
and won an humble place among our seven
hundred rising authors. What's the good of
that, when one is not a transcendent genius,
destined for posterity? The crowd seems
to be thickest just there: too many books, too
many writers, and by far too many anxious
aspirants. Why should I swell the number?
The community was not especially pining to
hear what I might have to say; and I did not
pine so much as some to be heard."</p>

<p>"I fear you lacked ambition, Harty. You
would have made a pretty good preacher; but
I suppose you weren't sanctified enough."</p>

<p>"Thanks: scarcely. I prefer to retain some
vestiges of self-respect. That will do for the
youths on the beneficiary list, who are taken
in and done for from infancy, to whom it is an
object to get a free education and into a gentlemanly
profession. That's the kind they
mostly make parsons of now, I hear. My
boy, to do anything really <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'on'">in</ins> that line, a man
ought to have notions different from mine&mdash;rather.
Why don't you advise me to set up a
kindergarten? That would suit as well as
chronicling ecclesiastical small beer. Cudgel
your brains, and start something more plausible."</p>

<p>This did not surprise me at all; but my
suggestion-box was getting low. Then I made
a rally. "How about the philanthropic
dodge? Robinson is on the Associated Charities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in town. I saw in the paper that he made
a speech the other night."</p>

<p>"If he does nothing better than speech-making,
he might as well drop it. There
might be something in benevolent efforts, if
one had just the temperament and talents for
them. But as it is, I fear most of it is humbug;
mutual admiration, seeing your name in
the paper, and all that. And how they get
imposed on! How they pauperize and
debauch those they try to raise! It's a law
of nature, Bob, that every tub must stand on
its own bottom: you can't reform a man from
without. Natural selection will have its way:
the shiftless and the lazy must go to the wall.
If you could kill them off, now, that might do
some good. The class that needs help is not
like us&mdash;not that we are anything to brag of:
they've not had our chance. It's very well
to say, give 'em a chance; but that's no use
unless they take it, which they won't. 'Who
would be free, themselves must strike the
blow.' If they wouldn't, you are bound to
respect their right of choice. Your drunken
ruffian will keep on breaking the furniture, till
another like him breaks his skull. His wife,
the washerwoman with six small children, will
continue getting more and making things
worse. This part of it at least ought to be
regulated by law: but that would be a restriction
of personal liberty, which is the idol of
this age, and not without reason. We're
between two millstones, and I see no way
out."</p>

<p>"How would you like politics? The gentleman
is supposed to have an opening there
now."</p>

<p>"A doubtful and difficult one. If it had
come in my time I might have tried it. But
it would be <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'up hill'">uphill</ins> work, a sort of Sisyphus
affair: you may get the stone to the top, but
the chances are against it. And which party
is one to join, when he sees nothing in either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
but selfish greed and stale traditions? Viewed
as a missionary field, Bob, it's just like the
ministry: you are weighed down with a lot of
dead conventions which you must pretend to
believe have life and juice in them yet.
Before you can do anything you must be a
partisan, and that requires a mediæval state of
mind. Mine, unluckily if you like, is modern.
It wouldn't go, Bob. Try again, if you have
more on your list."</p>

<p>"Well, there's pure Science: you wouldn't
care for the applied, I know. But you used
to like beetles and things. Truth for Truth's
sake is a fine motto, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if they lived by it. There was Bumpus,
old Chlorum's favorite student&mdash;in the
laboratory, you remember. The old man
died, and Bumpus stole all his discoveries,
and published them as his own; made quite a
pretty reputation, and is one of our leading
chemists. You know how the books on Astronomy
are made? A man finds out a thing or
two for himself, cribs the rest from other
books, changes the wording, and brings it all
out with a blare of trumpets as original
research. Those methods are approved, or at
least tolerated, in the best scientific circles,
and other folks don't know the difference.
O, I belong to a few societies yet, and once
in an age go to their meetings, when I get
tired up here."</p>

<p>"So the outside world still has charms, eh?
Have to go back to it now and then, to keep
alive, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when I need to be reconciled to solitude;
much as you go to hear Ingersoll when
your orthodoxy wants confirming, or Dr.
Deadcreed if your liberalism is to be stirred
up. Let us spice the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'insiped'">insipid</ins> dish with some
small variety. The lesser evil needs the
greater for its foil."</p>

<p>"Look here, Harty; this sounds like pure
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'perversness'">perverseness</ins>; opposition for its own sake, you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
know. I believe your money has been the
ruin of you. It's not an original remark, but
if you'd had nothing you'd have done something;
gone into business like the rest of us,
and made your way."</p>

<p>"Of course, if I had been obliged to; but I
should have loved it none the better. Poor
Bayard Taylor said a man could serve God
and mammon both, but only by hating the
mammon which he served from sheer necessity.
Say I got my living by a certain craft,
would that make the craft noble? 'Great is
Diana of the Ephesians,' because we sell her
images! Why should I desire to supply the
confiding public with shoes, or sugar, or sealing-wax?
Plenty of others can do that better,
and find it more amusing, than I should."</p>

<p>"If it's amusement you're after, most men
find it in Society. You're not too old for that
yet."</p>

<p>"Blind guide, I have been there. So long
ago, you say, that I've forgotten what it's like?
Not quite. Last winter I had to attend an
execution: couldn't get out of it, you know.
My cousin married a Washington belle, and
I had to be there a week, and take it all in.
Ah well, this is a threadbare theme; but I
could understand how men fifteen hundred
years ago fled from Alexandrian ball-rooms to
Nitrian deserts. The emptiness of it&mdash;the eternal
simper, the godless and harrowing routine!
If a man has brains or a soul about him, what
can he do with them in such a crowd? Better
leave them at home with his pocket-book, or
he might lose them&mdash;less suddenly, but more
certainly, I fancy. No, the clubs are not
much better; I don't care for horse-talk or
the price of shares. See human nature? not in
its best clothes&mdash;and you may read that remark
either way you like. Why man, you can get
all this in <i>Punch</i> and the novels, with far less
fatigue, and lay them down when you have had
enough. An hour on Broadway sickens me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
for the wild-flowers, the brooks, the free breeze
or the mountain side."</p>

<p>He was getting violent now, and I thought
I had better calm him down. "Oho! the
rhyme and reason of a rural life, is it?
Soothing effect of Nature on a world-worn
bosom, and all that? So you do believe in
something, after all?"</p>

<p>"I told you it was but a choice of evils, and
this is the less. Nature has neither heart nor
conscience, and she sets us a bad example.
She has no continuity, no reliableness, no self-control.
I can see none of the fabled sublimity
in a storm; only the pettishness of a
spoiled child, or of an angry man bent on
breaking things. The sunset is better to look
at, but it has no more moral meaning than a
peep-show. Yet this is a return to primitive
conditions, in a way. I can throw off here the
peddler's pack of artificialities that Vanity Fair
imposes, and carry only the inevitable burden
of manhood. The air is less poisonous to
body and mind than in the cities. The groves
were God's first temples, and may be the last."</p>

<p>"See here, Hartman. Suppose people in
general were to take up with these cheerful
notions of yours, and go away from each other
and out in the backwoods&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"It might be the best thing they could do.
But don't be alarmed, Bob: I am not a Nihilist
agent. Preserve your faith in the Oil Exchange
and the general order. I speak only
for myself, and I'm not proselyting to any
great extent. We'll have a week's fishing,
and then I'll send you back to your wife in
good shape. Or if you find yourself getting
demoralized, you can skip earlier, either home
or to a place further up that I'll tell you of,
where the few inhabitants are as harmless as
your youngest baby."</p>

<p>But I was not to be bluffed off in this way.
"Jim," I said, "there is something behind all
this. Was it that girl you met at Newport
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and afterwards in Naples? You told me
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the girl," he said. "You are
a married man, and I an old bachelor. Leave
girls to those who have use for them. If we
are to get any trout to-morrow, it's time we
turned in. And if you won't stay, I'll go
with you to the tavern and knock up old
Hodge: he's been asleep these four hours." I
thought he had talked enough for one night,
so I said no more, but got back to bed.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Worse_Yet" id="Worse_Yet"></a>II.</h3>

<h4>WORSE YET.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hartman</span> had asked me to stay with him,
but there is no use of overloading friendship,
and I like to be my own master as well as he
does. I might get tired of him, or he of me;
and it's not well to be chained to your best
friend for a solid week. Not that I am afraid
of Hartman; he is not a lunatic, only a monomaniac;
but I can cheer him up better when I
have a good line of retreat open. He took
me next morning to some superior pools,
where the trout were fat and fierce; but I
had not my usual skill. The truth is, Jim
was on my mind; and after missing several
big fish and taking a good deal of his chaff,
I begged off&mdash;said I had letters to write&mdash;and
so got to the tavern in time for dinner, which
they have at the pagan hour of half-past
eleven. Then I set to work thinking. I am
not quite so dull as I may seem, but Hartman
always had the ascendancy at college,
and last night I fell into the old way of playing
chorus to his high tragedy. This will not do,
and I must assert myself. He was much the
better student of course, but I have knocked
about and seen more of the world than he has,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
shut up in these woods like a toad in a tree.
He is too good a sort to go to seed with his
confounded whimseys; so I determined to
take a different tone with him. And I wrote
to my wife about it: Mabel is a competent
woman, and sometimes has very good ideas
where mine fail&mdash;though of course I seldom
let her see that. That evening I took him in
hand.</p>

<p>"Jim," I said, "I've been thinking&mdash;about
you."</p>

<p>"Ah," said he. "Large results may be
expected from such unusual exertion. Impart
them by all means."</p>

<p>"James Hartman, you are lazy, and selfish,
and unprincipled."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said he, in an inquiring tone.
"That is your thesis. Prove it."</p>

<p>I went on. "A man should be doing something:
you are doing nothing. A man should
have a stake in the community. What have
you got? Three dogs and an old cow. A
man should be in connection and sympathy
with the great tides of life. Here you are
with nobody but yokels to talk to, and the
pulse of the region about two to the minute."</p>

<p>"Twin brother of my soul, companion of
the palmy days of youth, methinks&mdash;as they
say in the wild and wondrous West&mdash;you hit
me where I live. But none of these things
move me. I am lost in admiration of your
oratory: really, Bob, I didn't think it was in
you. But you said all this, in simpler language,
last night."</p>

<p>I saw I had overshot the mark: when he
takes that tone, you are nowhere. "Jim," I
said, "let's be serious. Begin where we left
off, then. Granted that you don't care for
making money, and the ends most of us are
after. By character and fortune you are
above the usual selfish motives. Still you are
a man, a member of the community: you have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
duties to your fellows. Let the nobler
motives come in. Do something to make the
world happier, wiser, better. You have the
power, if you had the will. Are not private
talents a public trust? You used to berate
the hogs of Epicurus' sty. It seems to me
you've fallen back on mere self-indulgence.
Your life here is a huge egoism. Cut loose
from these withering notions: there is a better
side to things than the one you see. Come
back to the world, and be a man again."</p>

<p>His eye was very bright now&mdash;not that it
was ever dull&mdash;but I could not quite make
out what it meant; perhaps mere <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - original reads: 'curiosity,' with a comma">curiosity.</ins>
"Robert," he said, "I should believe that
somebody had been coaching you, but there's
no one in range who could do it except myself.
It's not like you to have brought books
along; and you've not had time to hear from
home. What put you up to this?"</p>

<p>"Hartman," I said, "look me in the eye
and see whether I mean what I say. Go back
with me next week. Make your home at my
house till you can look round. I'll introduce
you to some men who are not shams&mdash;and
women, if you like. I know a few who have
souls and consciences, though they do go to
parties. I'll help you all I'm worth. You
can make a new start. Something went
wrong before. Better luck this time."</p>

<p>"Bob," said he, "I'll take your word for it.
Deeply touched by such unexpected and undeserved
consideration&mdash;no, I won't chaff.
You're not half a bad lot. But, my dear boy,
you see the thing from your standpoint; mine
is different. I'll try to explain. But what
would you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is best for you. Anything, so
you get an object in life."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what De Senancour says,
in <i>Obermann</i>?"</p>

<p>"Not I. Put it in your own English, please:
no French morals in mine."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"What is there to be done that is worth
doing? It seems to me that everything is
overdone. I go into a town, big or little: ten
stores where one is needed. How do all these
poor creatures live? Do you see anything
noble in this petty struggle for existence? I
can't. I serve my kind best by getting out of
their way: that makes one less in the scramble."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't expect you to sell tape or taffy,
Jim. You could deal in a higher line of goods,
and do it in your own way."</p>

<p>"They don't want my goods, Bob, and I
can't do it in my own way. I have tried&mdash;not
much, but enough to see. There is no market
for my wares: and I'm not sure they are
worth marketing&mdash;or that any man's are.
Truth as I see it is the last article to be in
demand."</p>

<p>"As you think you see it just now, very
likely. Your eye is jaundiced, and sees all
things yellow. Get well, and you can find a
market. Fit your mind to the facts, and
receive a true impression."</p>

<p>"Exactly what I have done&mdash;so far as any
impression is true. That's the point I've been
waiting for you to come to. 'The Universe is
change, and Life is opinion.' As a man thinketh
in his heart, so is he; and as he thinks of
things outside himself, so are they to him. One
can do no more than use his eyes and brains,
and then rule himself by what he sees. I
have looked at matters more carefully and
dispassionately than some do, and seen a little
deeper into them: the prospect is not edifying,
Bob. I am prejudiced, you say? No, I have
cast aside prejudice. Most of you are misled
by the love of life: you want to give a favorable
account of your own belongings, and the
wish is father to the thought: so you blink
what is before you, and won't own the truth.
Perhaps you are wise in your way: you gain
such bliss as is in ignorance. Keep it if you
can: I have no desire to disturb it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
"Jim, mayn't there be a little conceit of
superior wisdom here?"</p>

<p>"Very possibly: as the lamented Bedott
observed, we are all poor creatures. 'I do not
speak as one that is exempt:' doubtless I
have my full share of infirmity."</p>

<p>"Then why not take the benefit of it, with
the rest of us? There's a better as well as a
worse side. Take things as they are, and
make the best of them."</p>

<p>"I do. The best is the least, and I get
away from things as much as possible. To
minimize life is to make the best of it."</p>

<p>"Now you're at it again; begging the question,
and dodging the argument&mdash;you'd say,
summing it up, I suppose. I tell you, it's all
mental, and your mind's diseased. You think
you're injured by the scheme of things. Well,
change your opinion, and the injury is gone.
Didn't one of your old philosophers say something
like that?"</p>

<p>"He didn't give it quite the application you
do, Bob. How can I change an opinion that is
based accurately on facts? I don't make the
facts: if I did, my opinion of myself would
be yet worse than it is. I have a brain&mdash;such
as it is&mdash;and a conscience: I can keep them
clean and awake, even on Crusoe's island.
Nothing better than that, my boy. 'What is
the good of man? Rectitude of will, and to
understand the appearances of things.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Hartman, if you had two or three
kids, as I have, you'd see things differently.
They would give you an interest in life."</p>

<p>"A tragically solemn one, no doubt. That
responsibility at least can't be forced on a
man. He can let his part of the curse die
out with him."</p>

<p>"Jim, you <i>are</i> selfish. You were made to
gladden some woman's eye and fill her
heart. You were the strongest man of the
nine, and the best oar in the crew. We all
envied your looks, and there's more of them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
now. You could outshine all the gilded
youth I know, and hold your own with the
best. I remember a girl that thought so, a
dozen years ago. Somewhere a woman is
waiting for you to come and claim her. Why
will you rob her and the world? This wilful
waste is selfish wickedness, that's what it is."</p>

<p>"Think so if you must: it's a free country.
But you sugar the pill too much. Who misses
me&mdash;or what if some few did for a while?
They've forgotten me long ago. I tell you, I
served society by deserting it."</p>

<p>"It's all very well now, Jim, while your
youth and strength last. But after you turn
forty, or fifty say, these woods and whims will
lose their charm; you'll get bored as you've
never been yet. The emptiness and dreariness
that you theorize about will become stern
realities: you'll pine, when it's too late, for
human affection and some hold on life. My
lad, you are storing up for yourself a sad old
age."</p>

<p>I thought I had him at last. His surface
lightness was all gone: he looked intent and
solemn. "No doubt of it, Bob; not the least
in life. I am human, and the worst is yet to
come. But do you think me such a cad as to
go back on my principles in search of so poor
a shadow as happiness? Shall I, in base hope
of easing my own burden, throw it on somebody
else who but for me might go through
existence lightly? Should I call sentient
beings out of the blessed gulf of nothingness,
that they may pay a duty to my weakness by
and by, and curse me in their hearts? That
would be somewhat too high a price to pay
for broth when I am toothless, and the coddling
comforts of one who has lived too long."</p>

<p>I am not thin-skinned, but his tone shocked
me. "Dear boy," I said, "they wouldn't
look at <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: 'it' does not appear in the original">it</ins> in that light. They would be your
wife and your children."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, still savagely, "they would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
be my wife and children&mdash;supposing your
unsupposable case. Grant that my notions
are as false and monstrous as you think them:
a pleasant lot for my wife, wouldn't it, to be
in constant contact with them? And my
children would have my blood in them&mdash;the
taint of eccentricity, perhaps of madness: O,
I've seen it in your eye. Others would think
so too&mdash;most, no doubt. No, Bob; better let
it die out with me."</p>

<p>"Jim, you make me tired. I'll go back to
the tavern." I was disappointed, and he
saw it.</p>

<p>"Don't make yourself wretched about me,
old man. Let this thing go&mdash;you can't mend
it. Follow your own doctrine, and take what
you find. We have the May weather, good
legs, and our tackle, and the brooks are full of
trout. I kill nothing bigger than fish, but if
you want a change I'll show you where you
can have a chance for deer. And for the
evenings, there are other topics besides
ourselves&mdash;or rather myself. You can tell me
about your children; they are likely to be
healthier than mine would be. Good night,
my boy: sound sleep, and no dreams of me."</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="Complications" id="Complications"></a>III.</h3>

<h4>COMPLICATIONS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> that I found it best to do as Hartman
had said. The sport was good, but I
failed to enjoy it. I suppose I was a fool, for
each of us makes or mars his own life, and it
is no use moping over your neighbor's blunders;
but I could not get that poor devil out
of my mind. He talks as well on one subject
as on another: it was I, not he, had brought
him under discussion; but the evenings dragged.
Then came a letter from home: the
distance is considerable, and the mails slow.
"Dear Robert," my wife wrote, "I am glad to
know you are so comfortable. Keep your
flannels on, and change your clothing when
you have been in the wet. The children are
well: Herbert fell over the banisters yesterday,
but fortunately without injury. Bring your
friend Mr. H. back with you; he seems to be
presentable, and evidently all he needs is a
little cheering feminine society." [Hum:
feminine society puts a higher estimate on its
own powers than I do, then.] "Clarice has
returned. You know how enterprising she is,
not to say wilful, and how fond she is of you.
She has taken a fancy to try your retreat, and
learn to catch trout." [She has, eh? Well,
let's get on with this.] "Jane will go with her,
of course: they start on Thursday. Secure
rooms for them, and have a vehicle to meet
them."</p>

<p>Here was a nice situation. To make Mabel
easy about me, I had enlarged too much on
the accommodations here; they are a long way
from what she supposes. I called the landlord.
"Hodge, here are two ladies coming
from the city. Where can you put them?"</p>

<p>"Wall, I d'no, Square. Ain't much used
to city gals. Hope they don't bring no
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sarrytogys. There ain't nothin but your
room, an mine, an old Poll's, and the gerrit.
Me and you might go out in the hayloft like,
or sleep on the pyazzer if the nights is warm."</p>

<p>While he <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'has'">was</ins> maundering on, the whole
truth flashed upon me. Why can't I see
things at once, like Hartman? If I had his
sharpness, and he my slow common sense,
there would be two men fit for this world's
uses&mdash;which neither of us appears to be, as the
case stands. I had rashly said too much about
Jim and his attractions. Mabel is a born manager
and matchmaker&mdash;can't endure to see an
eligible man uncaught. She has put the girls
up to this game: 'cheering feminine society,'
indeed! My sister Jane is a sensible woman
enough, and not much younger than I; but
Clarice is a beauty with six years' experience,
and irresistible, some think. 'Enterprising'&mdash;well,
I should say so: cheeky, you might
call it. Women do take such stunning liberties
nowadays. My wife would reprove me
for slang; but weaker words fail to express
the fact, and my feelings about it. I might
stand these girls coming up here after me&mdash;Clarice
is a sort of eighth cousin of Mabel's
and looks on me as a brother. But Jim&mdash;no.
She must be pining for more worlds to
conquer, and it would just suit her book to
bring a romantic hermit to her feet. I should
like well enough to see her try it, when I was
not responsible, but not under present circumstances.
Great Cæsar! Jim will think I
have put up this job on him, and never forgive
me: nor would I, in his place. This field is
getting too thick with missionaries.&mdash;"Hodge,
it won't do. Harness your old nag, and drive
me to the station. I must telegraph. And
while I'm there, I may as well put for home.
We can catch the night train if you hurry."</p>

<p>"Wall, Square, I don't cotton to suddint
changes: like to move when I git a good
ready. Ye put a man off his base, Darn&mdash;."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
I checked his incipient profanity. "My
friend, whether you like it or not is in this case
immaterial. I'll pay you for the time I meant
to stay, and all you like for the fifteen miles.
But be quick, now."</p>

<p>While he was hunting strings for his
broken buckboard, I threw my traps together,
and scratched a line to Jim: called home
by sudden press of business, I said&mdash;and so it
was, in a way. It is a long ride, but I had
enough to think of. At the depot I wired,
"Hold the girls. I am coming back." As I
straightened up from this exercise, there was
the old sinner grinning malignantly over my
shoulder. "Hodge," I said, "not a word
about the ladies to Mr. Hartman, mind," and
I gave him an extra dollar. This was another
mistake, I suppose.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Square: tain't me as goes
back on my friends." What could the old
fool be thinking of? I would have given him
some more cautions, but the train came, and I
was off.</p>

<p>You may imagine the reception at home. I
tried to take a high hand, but what can a
man do against three women? "I really think,
Robert," said Mabel, "that since the girls had
set their hearts on this excursion, you might
have indulged them." "The conceit of men!"
cried Clarice; "what had our coming to do
with Mr. Hartman? Is he lord of the manor,
that no one may trespass on his demesne?"
Jane too turned on me. "It was not very kind
of you, brother, to prefer a mere acquaintance
above your own sister, and suspect her motives
in order to save his peace, forsooth!" I knew
it was humbug; but I had to eat no end of
humble pie, all the same. You may believe
me or not&mdash;if you are a family man you will,
without difficulty&mdash;but I had to get those
women apart, and explain things to them one
at a time, before I could have peace in the
house. My own flesh and blood were soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
mollified; but Clarice has not forgiven me
yet. I have been on my knees to her, so to
speak&mdash;most men do it, and she expects it&mdash;but
it is of no use. "My dear Clarice," said
I, "you know I would do anything in the
world for you." "Yes," said she contemptuously,
"I've just had experience of it."
"But you don't know Hartman." "Then why
couldn't you let me know him?" "But it
wouldn't have done, under these circumstances.
He&mdash;I&mdash;." "Unhappy man," she
said, with her tragedy queen air, "is it possible
you imagined that you were a better
judge of the proprieties than I?" And that's
the way it goes. I am coming to believe Hartman
was right about the fate of philanthropic
efforts, at least.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this came a note from
Jim himself. "Dear Bob, I enclose something
which Hodge says you left behind."
[O thrice-accursed idiot, did I leave Mabel's
letter lying around loose?] "Of course I have
not looked into it, but I fear he has." [You
may bet on that: the only chance was that he
could not read her fine Italian hand.] "He
says one of your children fell down stairs: I
trust the results were not serious. Sorry
you left in such haste, and hindered the ladies
from coming. Hodge's quarters are not palatial,
but you could bunk with me, as I at first
proposed; and since they were willing to
rough it, we would have managed somehow.
You could surely rely on my humble aid
toward making their sojourn in the wilderness
endurable. And <i>per contra</i>, a little cheering
feminine society might have assisted your
benevolent efforts toward my reclamation.
Was it not selfish to leave me thus unconsoled
and unconverted?"</p>

<p>Well, the business is done now, with neatness
and dispatch. That beast Hodge has
told Jim all he knew or suspected, even to
that fatal phrase of my wife's: so there's an end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of his faith in me, and of any chance I might
have had to set him straight. That was a
fortnight ago, and I have not the face to answer
him. When I have any more doctrinaire
anchorites to convert, I shall not call a
family council. But alas, poor Hartman!</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="A_Wilful_Princess" id="A_Wilful_Princess"></a>IV.</h3>

<h4>A WILFUL PRINCESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> wrong about Hartman after all. He
has written me again, and this is what he says:</p>

<p>"Do you want to confirm the heretical opinions
you argued against so manfully? You
had revived my faith in friendship, Bob: I
believed, and would like still to believe, that
one man can be true and kind to another.
And perhaps in general you had stirred and
shaken me up more than you knew. Socrates
outranks Pyrrho, and I am open to conviction.
Possibly I have been too sweeping; I don't
wish to dogmatize. It may be that I have
lived alone too long, shut up in a narrow space,
where light could enter only through my perversely
colored glasses. At any rate, your coming
was like opening a door and letting in a
wholesome breeze. Have I offended you?
I thought I was past asking favors from my
kind: but do let me hear from you."</p>

<p>Of course I had to answer that, and worse,
to show it to the girls. Some men, now, would
keep it to themselves, and preserve their dignity;
but such is not my style. Let them
crow over me if they must.</p>

<p>They did. "Well, Robert," said Mabel, "you
see now how absurdly mistaken you were.
Perhaps hereafter you will allow us to manage
our own affairs, and not complicate them with
your bungling masculine attempts at superior
wisdom." "I am glad to know, brother," said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Jane, "that your friend is a gentleman, incapable
of the base suspicions you would have
attributed to him. You did your best to prevent
our knowing him and carrying out your
ideas for his improvement: now we shall be
able to meet him cordially, and try to cheer
him a little. But probably he is not at all as
dark as you have painted him."</p>

<p>Clarice would say nothing: she was in one
of her high and mighty moods. Her soul
is like a star, and sits up aloft; sometimes it
twinkles, but more generally it does not. I
often want to tell her that she is a creature too
bright and good to come to breakfast like
other folks; but somehow she has a way of
keeping people at a distance, and even of
repressing my pleasantries. We call her the
Princess: She has to be approached with
bated breath, and you must whisper your compliments
if you want to fire them off at her;
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'roar'">rear</ins> them as gently as a sucking child, in fact&mdash;and
then they are very seldom appreciated.</p>

<p>"Clarice," I said, "I want to get Hartman
down here. Do treat him kindly, please;
won't you, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: now? without quotation marks">now</ins>?"</p>

<p>She looked at me with her Juno air. "Why
should I treat him kindly?"</p>

<p>"O well, I won't say for my sake, because
you wouldn't care for that. But the poor
devil has lived in the woods so long."</p>

<p>"He might have been well enough in his
woods; but why should you bring your poor
devils into civilized society, and expect me to
bear with their gaucheries, in addition to your
own?"</p>

<p>There it is: she'll not forgive me in a year
for upsetting her fine plan of going up there
to beard the hermit in his den. She rarely
takes these fancies, I must own; and when
she does, she is not accustomed to be balked
of them. As it has turned out, I might as
well have let her have her way that time;
there was no harm in it. "Princess, haven't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
you trampled on me enough? I was wrong,
and I'm very sorry: what more can a man
say? But Hartman had no hand in that."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is clear now, no thanks to you.
Small merit in confessing after you are proved
guilty."</p>

<p>"Well, you are pretty hard on a fellow.
But you needn't punish Hartman for my fault.
Thrash me all you like, but give him a
chance. I give you my word of honor,
Clarice, he is a finished gentleman, and very
different from me. You needn't fear awkwardness
in him. I knew you would like him."</p>

<p>"How do <i>you</i> know what I would like? If
this Mr. Hartman wants to see a little of the
world, I have no desire to prevent his being
reclaimed from barbarism. Mabel and Jane
can do that, without my aid. To tell you the
truth, Robert, I don't care to meet the man,
after the disgusting complications which you
have introduced."</p>

<p>I groaned&mdash;I couldn't help it. "Princess,
please God, I will never interfere with you
again. You shall be safe from any meddling
of mine. If you will kindly say what you
want, and say it slow, so that my limited
faculties can take it in, I will try to act accordingly.
But, if I may make so bold as to inquire,
what are you up to now?"</p>

<p>"I shall go away. O, you need not feel so
badly about it, Bob: I am not tied to you and
Mabel. I was in the South all winter, you
know, and only returned while you were at your
fishing. I have a dozen invitations for the
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: punctuation on the original is unclear here">summer:</ins> I think I will join Constance."</p>

<p>"Not if I can help it, you won't. This is
your natural home, Clarice, and you shall not
be driven from it. Nobody shall enter here
who is not acceptable to you: if anything
about the house don't suit you, name it and it
shall be corrected. You know Jane and
Mabel worship you; so do the children, if you
count them. I'll not have Hartman; or I can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
entertain him at the club while you are all at
Newport."</p>

<p>"That will be hospitality indeed. Would
you desert your friend for me?"</p>

<p>"I would not desert you for all the friends
under the canopy. You have always ruled
the house when you deigned to be in it, and
you always will. I may be low in your books,
but it does not follow that you are not high in
mine. We can't do without you, Princess;
you must stay. Name your price, and I'll
pay it if it breaks me."</p>

<p>"Very well then; I will remain, and meet
your Mr. Hartman. But one thing must be
distinctly understood: there must be no more
crossing of my will. I must be absolutely free and
unhampered, to plan and carry out what I see
fit. I may possibly be wrong at times; but you
will not know when, and it is not for you to
judge. No more interference or opposition,
remember. Do the terms suit you?"</p>

<p>"O Lord, yes. I'll have a throne set up in
the drawing-room, and everybody shall approach
you Siamese fashion. And perhaps I
had better come to you to see if my tie is right
before dinner, and to practice what I shall say
when we have company."</p>

<p>"It might improve you. But Mabel should
be competent to attend to those trifles. On
one point I must instruct you, though. I shall
doubtless do things that appear to you strange,
perverse, incomprehensible. In such cases it
will be best for you to walk by faith. No
meddling nor espionage, mind."</p>

<p>"Clarice, you don't think me capable of
playing the spy on you?"</p>

<p>"Not that exactly, but you sometimes indulge
in little tricks and stratagems: you like to
think that you hoodwink your wife&mdash;not that
it ever succeeds&mdash;in small unimportant
matters. Mabel and Jane may endure your
attempts, if they like; but don't try them on
me. They would never deceive me for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
moment, of course; but I can't waste time in
explaining that to you in detail. Besides,
your fancied success would unsettle your mind,
and so tend to disturb the domestic equilibrium."</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Clarice! would I lie to
you?"</p>

<p>"No: you dare not. But let me have no
subterfuges, no concealments, and no criticisms.
What I may do you cannot expect to
understand, nor is it necessary that you
should."</p>

<p>"Well, thought has been hitherto supposed
to be free. When I see you at those little
games of which you are to enjoy a monopoly,
can't I have an opinion of them?"</p>

<p>"O yes. The opinion will be of small value,
but your poor mind must be amused and occupied
somehow, I suppose. But you will be
carrying your opinions about the house, and
introducing an element of confusion. If you
could keep your own counsel, now&mdash;but that
is hopeless."</p>

<p>"When you are operating on Hartman, for
instance, it might confuse the programme if
I were to say anything to him, eh?"</p>

<p>"When I take Mr. Hartman up, it will be
very much better for his welfare and yours for
you to leave him in my hands."</p>

<p>"O, he would rather be left there, no doubt,
though they grind him to powder. But what
the deuce am I to do? If I mayn't talk to <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'any, body'">anybody</ins>
else, can't I come to you with my
opinions&mdash;in odd moments, when your serene
highness has nothing better on hand?"</p>

<p>"You may bring your valuable ideas to me,
and I will hear them, when I have leisure and
inclination. Yes, that will be best. But no concealments,
mind. When you think you know
anything that affects me, come to me with it
at once: otherwise you will be blurting it out
to somebody else. You promise?"</p>

<p>"I swear, by all my hopes of your royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
favor. Anything else? I mean, has your
majesty any further commands? You'll have
to give me audience about three times a day,
you know, to keep me in mind of all these
rules, or I'll be safe to forget some of them."</p>

<p>"You had better try to remember. I'll keep
an eye on you. And now do you want any
more, or have you learnt your lesson?"</p>

<p>"I'll trust so. Henceforth I shall not call
my soul my own. The humblest of your
slaves craves permission to kiss the royal
hand. I say, Clarice, you won't be rough on
poor Hartman, will you? He's had hard
lines: you could easily break him to pieces,
what is left of him."</p>

<p>"If there is so little left of him, there would
be small credit in breaking him to pieces, as
you elegantly express it. I shall probably
let him alone."</p>

<p>"Scarcely. There is a good deal left of
him yet: he is as handsome a fellow, and as
fine a fellow, as you'd be apt to find. You're
tired of the regulation article, dancing man
and such, that you meet every night: I don't
wonder. This is something out of the common.
He needs a little looking after, too.
I wish now I had let you get at him in May,
as you proposed."</p>

<p>"Robert, if you fling that odious and vulgar
figment of your debased imagination at
me again, I will go away and never come back.
You make me sick of the man's name. If you
ever breathe a hint of this disgusting slander
to him I will never forgive either of you, nor
speak to you."</p>

<p>"God forbid, Princess dear. Don't you
know that your good name is as sacred to me
as Mabel's? Wasn't I to come to you with
notions that I couldn't put in words to anybody
else?"</p>

<p>"Let them have some shadow of reason and
decency about them, then. Cannot a girl plan
a rural excursion, in company with your sister
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and under your escort, without being accused
of designs on a strange man who chances to be
in the neighborhood? You try my patience
sorely, Robert. I wonder how Mabel can endure
you."</p>

<p>"Well, he that is down can't fall any lower,
as it says in Pilgrim's Progress. Walk over
me some more, and then maybe you'll feel
better. What the d&mdash;There, I'm at it again.
Clarice, it might improve me if you would
mix a little kindness with your corrections;
handle me as if you loved me, like the old
fisherman with his worms, you know. It discourages
a fellow to get all kicks and no kisses."</p>

<p>"Robert, look me in the eye and swear to
purge your mind of that vile thought, and
never to admit another that dishonors me."</p>

<p>"O, I swear it. Bring me the Thirty-nine
Articles and the Westminster Catechism and
the Ten Tables, and I'll subscribe to all of 'em.
I'll think anything you tell me to: I signed
my soul away an hour ago." Here I saw that
I had gone too far, and she was really angry.
She's right; I must learn to check my confounded
tongue, if I am to keep on any terms
with the Princess. So I changed my tune,
just in time. "Don't go, Clarice. Honestly, I
beg your pardon; upon my soul, I do. Your
word is all the evidence I want of any fact
under heaven, of course. Princess dear, I've
been fond of you since you were a baby, and
it has grown with your growth&mdash;it has, really.
I'll prove it some day: you wait and see.
Forgive me this once, won't you? Don't
speak, if you are tired, but just give me your
hand, as they did in the Old Testament, in
token of forgiveness."</p>

<p>She gave it. I am not good at descriptions,
but a man might go barefoot and fasting for a
week, and be paid by touching such a hand as
that. The queer thing is that I've known
Clarice for over twenty years&mdash;I told you she
had been in society for six&mdash;and practically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
lived with her most of that time, and yet she
grows more surprising every day. It seems
to be generally supposed that familiarity
breeds contempt in such cases; that sisters,
and wives, and the like, get to be an old story
to the men who belong to them. Clarice is
not that kind: possibly I am not. To be sure,
she is neither my wife nor any blood relation;
but I don't see that that makes any difference.
They took out a patent for her up above, and
reserved all rights, with no power of duplication.
She might care for me a little more;
but then I don't suppose I've ever given her
any reason to. I am well enough in my way,
but I'm not such an original and striking
specimen of my 'sect' as she is of hers&mdash;not
by a long shot. She was exhausted now, and
that is how I got a chance to put in all this
wisdom just here. I might talk to Mabel for
a week, and it would produce no effect: but a
little thing upsets the Princess, her organization
is so delicate and sensitive. She is all
alive and on fire, or else languid and disdainful:
she can't take life easily, as people of
coarser grain do, like me. Her brain weighs
too much and works too hard; that uses her
up. I don't doubt she has a heart to match;
but it has never yet waked up to any great
extent, so far as I have seen or heard. No
matter; people will care for you all the same,
Beauty, whether you care for them or not.
Don't fancy that I am the only one&mdash;far from
it: but I have the luck to be her adopted
brother from infancy, and to have access to
her when others have not. She is not always
kind&mdash;very seldom, in fact, up to date: but it
is a privilege to look at her, and any treatment
from her is good enough for me. She
used to tyrannize over me in this way when
she was ten and I twenty, and so it will be, no
doubt, to the end of the chapter. Outside, I
sometimes take on a man-of-the-world air,
and fancy that I can think of you lightly, my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Princess&mdash;that is the correct society tone, and
it does not pay to display the finer feelings of
our nature to the general world: but when I
come under the spell of your presence, I know
that that is all humbug, and that you are Fair
Inez of the ballad, God bless you. You and
Hartman ought to get on together: it might
be a good thing for you both&mdash;him especially.
Mabel and Jane are women too, but they are
as devoted to you as I am, according to their
lights, and more jealous for you: jealousy
seems to be no part of me, luckily. Well, between
us we ought to be able to keep all harm
from you, if you will let us.</p>

<p>Of course I didn't say all this out loud, but
only thought it. Then she opened her eyes
and yawned a little.</p>

<p>"Have I been asleep, Bob? I must have
been: you tired me so. O yes, I know you
think a good deal of me: that is an old story.
Well, anything more?"</p>

<p>"Only about poor Hartman, dear: you
didn't promise yet."</p>

<p>"Well, when he comes I will look him over
and see what is to be done with him. I must
go upstairs and dress now." And with this
I had to be content.</p>

<p>This conversation occurred of a Sunday
afternoon, when Mabel and Jane had gone to
Church, and taken Herbert with them: the
infants were out for an airing with their nurse.
Fortunately there was a long missionary sermon,
and a big collection, to which I must
send five dollars extra: the occasion was worth
that much to me. As the Princess left the
room, they came in. They looked at her, then
at me. "What have you been doing to Clarice,
Robert?"</p>

<p>"Only preparing her to receive Hartman."</p>

<p>"Preparing her! you great goose, what does
she want with your preparation? You'll only
prejudice her against him, and spoil any
chances he might have. Let her alone, do.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Haven't you made mischief enough between
them already?"</p>

<p>That is all they know about it. Churchgoing
sometimes fails to bring the female mind
into a proper frame. But you see they are
ready to scratch out even my eyes at the
thought that I have been rubbing her down
the wrong way. No matter: I know what I
know, and they need not try to make me believe
that these things will go right without proper
management.</p>

<h3><a name="Consultation" id="Consultation"></a>V.</h3>

<h4>CONSULTATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> usually go to Newport for the summer.
As Mrs. Fishhawk says, the bathing is so fine,
and the cliffs are such a safe place for children
to play. Not that we care so much for the
society: the Princess has seen the vanity of
that and been bored with it, and the rest of
us are very domestic people. After much
persuasion through the mail, Hartman agreed
to join us there: I was to pick him up in New
York and take him down. A night or two
before this, Clarice took me out on the aforesaid
cliffs, which afford a fine walk in the
moonlight with the right kind of company,
but somewhat dangerous if you get spoony
and forget to look where you are going. The
Princess, it is needless to say, never commits
this folly: she always has her wits about her,
and wits of a high order they are, as not a
few men have found to their cost, myself
included,&mdash;many
and many a time. She opened
the ball.</p>

<p>"Robert, do you remember our compact?"</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to forget it. Your words
are my law, more sacred and peremptory than
the Ten Commandments, or those of the old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
codger who wrote 'em in blood because his ink
had given out. As a servant looks to the
hand of his mistress, so am I to watch your
dark blue eye for direction and approval.
Deign to cast a sweet smile, however faint, in
this direction occasionally: it won't cost you
much, and will encourage me. If the devotion
of a lifetime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all that: at least you've said
it often enough. Now you will have an opportunity
to put it in practice. Drop generalities,
and come to business."</p>

<p>"My heart's queen, I am all attention.
Speak, and thy slave obeys. Bid me leap
from yon beetling crag into the billows' angry
roar&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you stop that, or shall I go into the
house? We are not rehearsing private theatricals
now."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed? I thought we might be. I
expect to see some next week."</p>

<p>"You will see my place at table vacant if
you don't keep quiet, and listen to what I
have to say. I can join Constance yet. You
talk about your affection for me and anxiety
to serve me, and when I want something definite
of you, you go off into the Byronic, or the
Platonic, or what you would perhaps call the
humorous: it is not easy to discriminate them.
Once for all, will you do as I bid you, or not?"</p>

<p>When the Princess wants to bring a man to
book, he has to come there, and stay there till
he sees a favorable opening for a break: there
was none such just now. So I called in the
white-winged coursers of my too exuberant
fancy, locked them up in the barn, begged the
lady's pardon as usual, and composed myself
into an attitude of respectful and devout attention,
as if I were in church. It was not long
after dinner: I wanted to have some more fun,
but that did not seem to be just the time and
place for it. My preceptress eyed me sternly,
and waxed anew the thread of her discourse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
"I told you that my actions might appear
strange to your ignorance. I will tell you
now what my plan is, so far as is necessary for
your guidance: then perhaps you will have
sense enough not to go gaping about, but to
fall into line and do what is required of you.
I have determined to see very little of this Mr.
Hartman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O now, Clarice! After you promised! I
relied on you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be still, stupid, and hear me out. I shall
see but little of him at first. You have made
such an ado about the man, I am disposed to
be interested in him, for your sake. There,
that will do; let my hand be."&mdash;I was merely
pressing it a little, I assure you, to testify my
gratitude for this unusual consideration: I
don't know when she ever owned to doing a
thing for my sake before. "For your sake
first, you great baby, and then, if he is worth
it, for his own. But at the start, as I told you,
I must look him over; and that I can do best
at a little distance."</p>

<p>"And then you mean to take him in and do
for him? You can, of course; but, Princess
dear, be merciful&mdash;for my sake first, and then,
if he is worth it, for his own. Don't grind
him up too fine: leave pieces of him big
enough to be recognized and collected by his
weeping friends."</p>

<p>"Robert, you really ought to try to restrain
your native coarseness. What can a man like
you know of the motives and intentions of a
woman like me? Poor child, if I were to put
them before you in the plainest terms the
facts and the dictionary allow, you could not
understand them."</p>

<p>As a quartz-crusher the Princess could have
won fame and fortune. I hope she may not
pulverize Hartman as effectually as she does
me: he might not take it so kindly. To eliminate
the metaphor, she is a master at the
wholesome process of taking a man down: not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that I don't often deserve it, or that it is not
good for me. In fact, I've given her occasion,
from her youth up, to get her hand in; and
admiration of her skill binds up the wounds,
so to speak, with which my whole moral nature
is scarred at least sixteen deep. In case
you should not follow my imaginative style,
let me say in simpler language that I am used
to it; but another man might not understand
it. I consumed some more humble pie&mdash;these
desserts occur frequently in the symposia of
our conversations&mdash;and she resumed.</p>

<p>"So I will leave him to Jane at first. She
will be very sisterly and gracious, and will
make the first stages of his return to the world
easy and pleasant. This may last two days,
or two weeks."</p>

<p>"O, don't overdo it. He talked of staying
but a week or ten days."</p>

<p>"Dear Robert, you are so innocent. He
will stay as long as I want him to."</p>

<p>"What, whether you notice him or not?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Are you six years old? Have
you never seen me in action before?"</p>

<p>"Body of Venus and soul of Sappho, I give
it up. Of course you can do anything you like,
but I never realized that you could do it without
seeming to take a hand in the game. I
strew ashes on my head like what's-his-name,
and sit down in the dust at your feet. Forgive
a penitent devotee for forming such lame
and inadequate conceptions of your power.
But what part do you want me to dress for in
this improving moral drama?"</p>

<p>"Your part is very simple. Of course I must
be occupied. I should hardly shine as a wall-flower."</p>

<p>"You would shine anywhere. If you were
a violet by an old stone, you couldn't be half
or a quarter hidden from the eye. But the
supposition is impossible. If you were free,
no other girl in the room would have a
chance."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
"That is very passable, though not wholly
new. You are improving, Bob. If you would
give your mind to it, I could mould you into
tolerable manners yet.&mdash;Well, I might get
plenty of men from the houses around. But
they are tiresome&mdash;staler than you, my Robert,
though I see less of them&mdash;and I can't take
the same liberties with them I do with you.
You are to belong to me as long as I may want
you."</p>

<p>"That is not new at all, Princess. It has
been so for years. Everybody about the house
knows that, even the servants&mdash;and all our
friends."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. But I am to make special
use of my property for the next few days.
You will have to be in constant attendance.
You ought to enjoy the prospect, and the
reality when it comes."</p>

<p>"I do; I shall: bet your boots on that. O
confound it, I've got my lines mixed already."</p>

<p>"Rather. If you startle the audience with
such a speech as that, what will Mr. Hartman
think? You must put on your prettiest behavior,
Bob. Make a desperate effort, and try
to keep it up&mdash;for my sake, now."</p>

<p>"For your sake I can be Bayard and Crichton
and Brummell and all those dudes rolled
into one. I'll order some new clothes when I
go down. And you will have to be very
gracious to me, you know."</p>

<p>"Am I not gracious enough now, pet? How
is this for a rehearsal?"</p>

<p>"Beyond my wildest dreams, Empress.
When you treat me thus for an hour, I can
bear your ill usage for a year."</p>

<p>"There will be no ill usage at present, if you
behave. Now don't forget, and spoil the play.
Understand, you are to pair off with me, as
Mr. Hartman with Jane. Mabel is mostly occupied
with the children; we will all look
after her, of course. And there will be mixing
and change of partners, but not much.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
You must watch, and obey my slightest hint&mdash;the
turn of an eyelid, the flutter of a fan.
I'll teach you all that."</p>

<p>"I know a lot of it already: when it comes
to watching you, I am a dabster. I'll behave
as if I was at school to Plato and Confucius,
and in training to succeed them both. Do you
know, Princess, if you were to treat a stranger
for half a day as you are treating me now, he
would want to die for you?"</p>

<p>"He might die for want of me before
the day was over, if he grew lackadaisical over
his wants. All men are not so chivalrous as
you, my poor Robert. You may have to do
that sort of dying before long. You must be
ready to be dropped when the time comes to
change the figures. No growling or moping,
mind: you must submit sweetly, and take
your place in the background with Jane,
while the rest of the play goes on."</p>

<p>"I know: I've been there before. I can find
consolation in seeing you carry the leading
part. One set of men passes away, and another
set comes on; but the Princess goes on
conquering, regardless of the moans of her
victims as they writhe on the bloody battlefield.
O, I'm used to being shoved aside, and
feeding on my woes in silent patience. The
flowret fades when day is done, and so does
every mother's son Who thinks his course is
just begun, And knows not that his race is run&mdash;How
does it go on, Clarice? I forget the
rest of it."</p>

<p>"It is a pity you didn't forget the whole of it.
I would if I were you, and quickly, lest you
horrify some one else with it. You are too
big to pose as a flowret, Bob."</p>

<p>"Polestar of my faith, see here. I'll have to
be around with Hartman, smoking and so on,
nights, after you and the rest have turned in,
and often in the daylight. You and Jane
can't attend to his case in person all the time,
you know, and I'm his host. What shall I say
about you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
"Anything you like. Praise me to the skies,
of course. That will be in keeping with your
part as my cavalier; and he will see how
things are between us&mdash;on your side, I mean.
Tell him about my few faults, if you can bring
yourself to mention them. Yes, you must;
they will set off my many virtues. Be perfectly
natural about it: you have known and
cherished me from infancy, and so forth. Not
a word, of course, about our compact, and
these rehearsals, and my coaching you&mdash;O
you great booby, were you capable of blurting
that out? If you do, you'll spoil all, and
I'll never forgive you. Remember now:
you profess to dread my anger, and you have
reason; you've felt it before. If you want me
ever to trust you again, keep to yourself what
is between us; regard it as sacred. O, I know
you profess to look at all that belongs to me
in that light; but show your faith by your
works. Swear it to me now."</p>

<p>I swore. That is a ceremony which has to
be gone through rather frequently with the
Princess, and somehow I don't mind it. But
how the deuce is one to remember all these
rules and regulations? I'll have to get Clarice
to write them out for me, by chapter and
verse, with big headings; then I'll get the
thing printed, and carry it about with me, and
study it nights and mornings. But Mabel
might find it in my clothes: she is welcome to
my secrets, but this is not mine. I might
have it printed in cipher; but then I should
be sure to lose the key. O, confound it all,
I'll have to chance it: I'll be sure to slip up
somewhere, and then there'll be a row. Well,
why borrow trouble? Let's gather the flowers
while we may: only there are none just here,
and it is too dark to find them. Then a
thought suddenly struck me: why not head
off the difficulty by improving my position
beforehand? "Princess dearest, do you like
me better than you used to, or is this only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
part of the play, the excitement of practicing
for a newcomer? Tell me, please&mdash;there's a
dear."</p>

<p>We were near the house now, and she darted
away from me. "If you tells me no questions,
I asks you no lies," she sang gaily as she ran
in. O shades of Juliet and Cleopatra, what a
woman that is&mdash;or what an idiot I am: I can't
be sure which till I get an outside opinion.
I'd give odds that within a fortnight Hartman
will be far gone. It will be life or death for
him, poor old man. But he's nigh dead now,
inwardly speaking, and so has not much to
lose. Anyway, he'll see that a world with
Clarice in it is not as blank and chilly as he
thinks it now&mdash;not by several thousand degrees.
I fancy his thermometer will begin to
go up pretty soon. He needs shaking up and
turning inside out and upside down&mdash;a general
ventilating, in fact, and I rather think Miss
Elliston will administer it to him.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Preparation" id="Preparation"></a>VI.</h3>

<h4>PREPARATION.</h4>

<p>I was mighty glad that Clarice felt this way
about Hartman's coming; she has not waked
up so, or come down from her Olympian
clouds of indifference, in a long time. But
still I thought it best to go around and make
some more preparations. When I have a
secret to carry, it oppresses my frank and open
nature more than you would think; and I find
that I can conceal it best by inquiring concerning
the matter of it of persons who know nothing
about it. Naturally I began with the
head of the house. That is myself, I suppose,
nominally; but every decent man allows his
wife to fill the position, and get what comfort
she can out of it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
"Mabel," I said, "I hope that Hartman will
enjoy himself here."</p>

<p>"You told us he was not given to enjoying
himself; on the contrary, quite the reverse.
No doubt he will take us as he finds us. He
will hardly want to go out to dinner every
day, and meet the Vanderdeck's and the foreign
princess."</p>

<p>"But, Mabel, I trust you are all prepared to
meet him in the right spirit."</p>

<p>"What absurd questions you ask, Robert.
You talk as if he were a bishop, come to convert
us: I thought we were to convert him. I
hope I do not need to be instructed how to receive
my husband's friends. And Jane is
ready to take an interest in him: she can be
very nice, you know."</p>

<p>"And Clarice: will she do her part?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows what Clarice will do on
any occasion. She would be more apt to do
what you wish if you would not trouble her
about Mr. Hartman. We are not three little
maids from school, to be taught our manners.
Why can you not learn that matters would
move just as well, yes, and better, without
your continual interference, dear? Your
blunders only complicate them, and disturb
the harmony."</p>

<p>Now that is a nice way for the wife of one's
bosom to talk, isn't it? How often, O how
often, would I remove the clouds of care from
her placid brow, and smooth her path through
life by graceful persiflage and appropriate
witticisms: but she does not seem to appreciate
them. I fear she must have had some
Scottish ancestors. Sometimes I think she
does not appreciate <i>me</i>. It is a cold world;
a cold, heartless, unfeeling, unresponsive
world, in which the sensitive spirit may fly
around promiscuously like Noah's dove, and
have to stay out in a low temperature. Wisely
and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'benificently'">beneficently</ins> is it arranged that Virtue
should be her own reward, since she gets no
other. I will try Jane next.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
"My dear sister, you know I go to town to-night,
and expect to bring Hartman back.
You will receive him kindly, for my sake,
will you not?"</p>

<p>Jane is a little prim at times, and I have
to arrange my sentences carefully, when I am
with her.</p>

<p>"I will do that, of course: why so many
words about it? Have you not been preparing
me, and all of us, for this visit, for the last
month? We know what is right, Robert: <i>your</i>
behavior is the only doubtful part."</p>

<p>"But Clarice, sister? She is always so
doubtful, as Mabel says; so capricious, so
haughty, so unapproachable. You have great
influence with her. Dear Jane, can you not
persuade her to treat my poor friend kindly?"</p>

<p>"Now, brother, why will you be such an unconscionable
humbug? We all know that you
are in her confidence, when any one is. What
were you two talking about all last evening?
Hatching some plot, no doubt. But it was not
intended to be practiced on me&mdash;not on her
part; that is your unauthorized addition to
her text." And the maiden assumed the part
of Pallas, and gazed at me with severity, as if
she would read my inmost soul. But she can't
beat Clarice at that. See here, young lady,
you are too sharp; you are getting dangerously
near the truth. I came near saying this
out, but did not. Instead I took an injured
tone.</p>

<p>"You are a pretty sister, Jane, to go about
suspecting me this way, and accusing me of
intrigue and hypocrisy, and all kinds of black-hearted
wickedness. What would I want to
deceive you for? You know we all have to
consider Clarice, and humor her: she is an
orphan, and we are her nearest friends. She
amuses herself with me sometimes, for want of
another man at hand, and then throws me
aside when the fit is over."</p>

<p>"O yes, we all know that, of course. Well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
brother, you can go to town with an easy
mind. Leave Mr. Hartman to Clarice and me;
when she is not in the humor to attend to him,
I will."</p>

<p>Now how does Jane come to know so much?
Has the Princess been taking her into the
plan too, as well as me? That I don't believe.
Clarice would expect Jane to take her cue by
intuition, and not bother to coach her as she
has me: perhaps she can trust Jane farther.
That must be it: one woman can see into
another's mind where a man couldn't. I must
put a mark on that for future reference. They
do beat us at some minor points. Well, I
didn't exactly get the best of that encounter:
it seems to me I owe Jane one, which I must
try and remember to pay.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Initiation" id="Initiation"></a>VII.</h3>

<h4>INITIATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hartman</span> arrived on schedule time, and was
duly taken home with me. "Old man," I
said, "welcome back to the amenities of life;
to the tender charities of man and woman; to
the ties, too long neglected, which bind your
being to the world's glad heart. You are the
prodigal returning from sowing his wild oats
in the backwoods: the fatted calf shall be
killed for you, in moderation, as per contract,
and the home brewed ale drawn mild. We
are quiet people, and live mostly by ourselves:
that will suit your book. The giddy crowd,
in its frivolous pursuit of amusement and
fashion, surges by in the immediate vicinity,
and old Ocean, in his storm-tost fury, dashes
his restless waves upon our good back door,
or adjacent thereto. But we give small heed
to either one of them. The sea views and
feminine costumes are supposed to be of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
highest order, and there is polo at stated intervals,
if you care for such; but these vanities
have little to do with the calm current of our
daily life. You will shortly have in front of
you a christian family, united in bonds of
long-tried affection and confidence. The
earthly paradise, James, must be sought in the
peaceful bosom of one's Home. After tossing
on the angry billows of Water Street, how
sweet to return to this haven of rest! And
you too, world-worn and weary man of woes,
shall receive attention. The furrows of care
shall be smoothed out of your manly brow:
gentle hands will bind up your wounds&mdash;even
the one you got from that girl a dozen years
ago, if it isn't healed yet. The shadows of
gloomy and soul-debasing Theory will flit
away from your bewildered brain, and in this
healthful atmosphere your spirit will regain
its long-lost tone, and embrace once more the
ethereal images of Hope and Joy and Faith.
Probably you will yet find some one to love in
this wide world of sorrow; anyway, we hope
to send you forth clothed and in your right
mind."</p>

<p>"I hope I'm properly clothed now, or will
be with what I've got in my trunk; and I
need to be in my right mind to take in all this
eloquence. I was mistaken about you, Bob;
you should have been a preacher. The only
drawback is, you don't stick to one key long
enough: these sudden changes in your woodnotes
wild might confuse a congregation."</p>

<p>"The church lacks vivacity and sense of
humor, Jim: she's all for a dull monotone.
Old Fuller is dead: his mantle descended on
me, but they don't appreciate that style nowadays.
To return to our topic, and deal with
the duty that lies nearest. In an humble and
pottering way, we are a happy family, James.
We envy not the rich and great: seek elsewhere
their gilded saloons, and tinsel trappings
of pride; but you will find things pretty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
comfortable. I regret to say we'll have to do
our smoking out of doors; but it is generally
warm enough for that. If we are noted for
anything, it is for modest contentment, unassuming
virtue, and cheerful candor&mdash;just as
you see them in me. Each face reflects the
genuine emotions and guileless innocence of
the heart connected therewith; more than
that, they reflect one another, as in a glass.
You can look at Mabel, and see all that is
passing in my capacious bosom. We share
each other's woes, each other's burdens bear,
and if we don't drop the sympathizing tear
frequently, it is because there is very seldom
any call for it. We have no secrets from one
another: limpid and pure flows the confidential
stream&mdash;but it flows no further than the
fence. You can say what you like to any of
us, and it will not go out of the house&mdash;unless
the servants overhear it; you'll have to look
out for that, of course."</p>

<p>"See here, Bob; judging by you, I had no
idea I was coming among such apostolic manners,
or I'd have taken a course of À Kempis.
Are there any prayer-meetings near by, where
I can go to freshen up?"</p>

<p>"Within a mile or two, no doubt. Jane can
tell you about them; she can lend you a prayer-book,
anyway. But I was not meaning to
discourage you: they will make allowances.
My wife is an exemplary woman; if you want
to get on with her, you'll have to take an
interest in Herbert's bruises when he falls
over the banisters. He is the only one of the
children who will trouble you much; the
others are small yet, happily. My sister is a
pattern of propriety, but of rather an inquiring
mind, and sympathetic if you take her the
right way: she can talk with you about philosophy
and science and your dried-up old
doxies. Not that she knows anything about
Schopenhauer, and Darwin, and Diogenes, of
course; but she's heard their names, and she'll
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
pretend to be posted&mdash;you know how women
are. And when you need a mental tonic&mdash;the
companionship of a robust intellect, the
stimulus of wide acquaintance with the great
world of men and things, a manly comprehension
of any difficulties that you may meet, or
sound and wise advice how to steer your way
through the pitfalls and intricacies of the
female character&mdash;in such cases, which will no
doubt often arise, you have only to come to
me. I know all about these matters, of which
you have had no experience. I'll be at home
as much as possible while you are there, and
I'll stand by you, Jim."</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully&mdash;as I believe they say
where we are going. Yes, you will be an invaluable
mentor, Bob. Well, I'll try not to
disgrace you. It is late: let us turn in."</p>

<p>This important conversation took place on
the boat. You see, when I was with Hartman
in May, he took the lead; but in my own
house, or on the way to it, I like to be cock of
the walk. Besides, as I had prepared the
women for his coming, so now it was necessary
to prepare his mind to meet them. In my
picture of our domestic felicity, I may have
laid on some tints too heavily, as about our
mutual confidence. But he will soon see how
that is. You may notice that I said nothing
about the Princess. There was a deep design
in that omission. When the orb of day in all
his glory bursts from his liquid bed upon the
astonished gaze of some lonely wanderer on
the Andes, or the Alps,&mdash;or our own Rockies,
say,&mdash;the spectacle is all the more effective if
the wanderer was not expecting anything of
the kind; didn't suppose it was time yet, or,
still better, didn't know there was any sun.
That is the way Jim will feel when he sees
Clarice. If he has forgotten about her wanting
to go up there in the woods in <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: 'May.' with a period">May,</ins> O. K.;
that will meet her views, and he'll be reminded
of her existence soon enough.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
This is one of those delicate ideas which
might not occur to the male mind unassisted:
in fact, left to my native nothingness, I should
probably have enlarged on her charms most
of the evening. But she laid special stress on
this point, that I was to say as little as possible
about her beforehand, and fortunately I remembered
it. Hartman thinks he is going to
have a safe and easy time with me and two
highly respectable ladies of sedate minds and
settled habits. Sleep on, deluded James,
while I finish my cigar here on deck: dream
of the forest and the trout brooks, and your
neighbor Hodge and your old tomcat. By
to-morrow night your mental horizon will be
enlarged, and when you return to your castle
in the wilderness there will be some new sensations
tugging at your vitals. It will be a
change for you, old man, and you needed one.
Well, I've given you enough to think of for
now, and you'll get more before you are a
week older. I hope he will come through it
right: it is like taking one's friend to the surgeon
to undergo an operation, when he doesn't
know that anything ails him or is going to be
done. Poor old Jim, I wouldn't have put up
such a job on you if I didn't believe it was for
your good. I am not a pessimist like you: I
believe in God and the Princess.</p>

<h3><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>VIII.</h3>

<h4>INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> drive from the wharf is too long: I
often think that the older part of the town
ought to be submerged, or removed to one of
the adjacent islands. We met the family at
breakfast, and I said, "Ladies, you see before
you a wild man of the woods, brought hither
to be subdued and civilized by your gentle
ministrations. By the way, Mabel, there was
a corner in oil yesterday. I made fourteen
thousand, and Simpkins went under; so you
can have that new gown now." They paid
no attention whatever to these pleasantries.
Clarice was not there, or the sparkling fount
of humor would have flowed less freely.</p>

<p>Hartman has very good manners when
he chooses, and in my house he would naturally
choose; so he got on well enough. The
children took to him at once, and he seemed
to take to them. After breakfast I led him
out for a walk, to show him the points of interest.
Several very creditable cottages have
been put up since he was here last: in fact,
this is quite a growing place, for the country.
As we went back he suddenly said, "Bob, who
is this Clarice that your sister mentioned at
the table? Fancy name, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"O no," I said as indifferently as I could.
He ought not to go springing her on me in
that way: it makes a man nervous. "She's
an orphan; a sort of cousin of Mrs. T. Got no
brothers or sisters, and all that sort of thing;
so we look after her a good deal. Sometimes
she's with us, sometimes she's not. Was south
all winter: got back while I was up there with
you."</p>

<p>Now what the deuce did I say that for? It'll
brush up his rusty mental machinery, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
help him to recall what she wants forgotten.
Just so; of course.</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember. She thought of joining
you with Miss Jane. I wish you had let them
come."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, you don't know what these
girls are used to; I do. There were no fit
quarters for them at Hodge's. I had gone
and written my wife a lot of rot, pretending
his place was much better than it is."</p>

<p>"With your usual unassuming virtue and
cheerful candor; yes. We have no secrets
from one another: the limpid stream of confidence
flows unchecked and unpolluted. Just
so. But see here, you old hypocrite, if there
is another young woman in the family, you
ought to have told me about her last night,
when you were preparing my mind, you know,
and pretending to explain the whole domestic
situation.&mdash;Great heavens, who's that?"</p>

<p>We had turned a corner, and come plump
on the house; and there on the piazza, two
rods away, sat a rare and radiant maiden,
playing cat's cradle with my eldest son and
heir. I can't tell you how she was dressed;
but she was a phantom of delight when thus
she broke upon our sight; a lovely apparition,
sent to be Jim Hartman's blandishment. At
least so it seemed, for he stood there and stared
like a noble savage. As when the lightning
descends on the giant oak in its primeval solitude&mdash;but
I must stop this; she is too near,
though she pretends not to see us yet. So I
whispered in low and warning <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: tones; with a semi-colon">tones</ins>:</p>

<p>"Brace up, Jim. She's not the one you
met here twelve years ago, who jilted you at
Naples: this one wasn't out of her Fourth
Reader then. Don't get them mixed, or be
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'decieved'">deceived</ins> by a chance resemblance." I thought
it was better to lay his embarrassment on that
old affair, you see. But that was all nonsense:
he never saw anybody like Clarice before&mdash;how
should he?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
"Confound you, Bob," he muttered between
his teeth, "so you've been practising your
openhearted innocence on me. Get on with
it now, and finish it up."</p>

<p>He pulled himself together, and I went
through the introduction with due decorum;
then I got away as soon as I could. You see,
I was unmanned by the spectacle of so much
young emotion, and somewhat exhausted by
my own recent exertions. I found a cool
corner in the library; and presently Jane had
to come in. "What is the matter with you,
Robert? Why do you sit there grinning like
an idiot?" Perhaps a smile of benevolence
had overspread my striking countenance; and
that's the way she distorts it. I could not tell
her what pleased me, so I said I had been
reading a comic paper. "You write your own
comic papers, I suspect; and bad enough they
are. If you go on at this rate, you will end by
editing the <i>Texas Siftings</i>. Do try to be decent,
brother, while you have a guest in the house."
I suppose she thinks that is a crushing rebuke,
now. I said I would try, and told her she had
better join Clarice and Hartman, who would
probably be tired of each other by this time.
Here again I have played into the Princess'
hands. She doesn't want Jim to see too much
of her at first, but to get used to the blinding
glare by degrees, and take his physic in small
doses, until he can bear it in larger. At least
I hope so: if I've made a mistake and spoiled
the procession, I'll learn it soon enough. But
Jane wouldn't go unless it was right: that's
the good of being a woman. You don't catch
me interrupting them, or going near the Princess
when she has any of her procedures on
foot, unless I am called.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="At_Newport" id="At_Newport"></a>IX.</h3>

<h4>AT NEWPORT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I could</span> not tell you all that occurred that
week; but it went exactly as Clarice intended
and had foretold. She was gracious and equable
and gentle, a model young lady of the
social-domestic type; but Hartman did not see
much of her. I on my part was kept
steadily occupied, what with boats, and
horses, and parasols, and fans, and wools,
and wide hats, and more things than you
could think of. It was, "Robert, come out on
the cliffs," or "Robert, get my garden gloves,
please; they are in the sitting-room, or somewhere
else;" or "Robert, take me to town;
I must telegraph to Constance;" or "Bob
dear, would you mind running over to Miss
Bliffson's, and telling her that I can't go to the
Society this afternoon; and on your way back,
stop at the milliner's and see if my hat is
done." I usually attended to these commissions
promptly; when you have women about,
your generous heart will rejoice to protect
and indulge their helplessness. They are the
clinging vine, you are the sturdy oak; and
then, as I said, Clarice is an orphan. Hartman
at first showed an inclination to relieve
me of the lighter part of these useful avocations,
such as taking her about over the rocks
and in the bay; but she very quietly, and without
the least discourtesy, made him understand
that no foreigners need apply for that
situation. Other men were coming after her
every day, but she avoided them or sent them
to the right about: she can do that in a way
to make you feel that you have received a
favor. She kept reminding me that it was my
business to wait on her: if these things were
paid for in cash, I should want high wages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for the duties are far from light. But I can
stand it: within the bosom of Robert T. glows
a spark of warm and pure philanthropy.
When I see my fellow-creatures in need, and
this good right arm refuses to extend its
friendly aid, may my hand cleave to the roof
of my mouth&mdash;O well, you know what I
mean. I used to retire to my meagre and
philosophic cot-bedstead with aching limbs
and an approving conscience: I never was
worked so hard before. Some of these
errands were perfectly needless, I knew. She
can't want to get me out of the way for an
hour or two, for I am never <i>in</i> the way; nor
simply to show what she can do, for that is an
old story, familiar to all concerned. Doubtless
she has some high moral end in view;
perhaps to teach Hartman what are the true
relations of man and woman, and how the
nobler animal can be trained to be a helpmeet
and boy-of-all-work to the weaker. Whether
this will suit his views I doubt; but she
knows what she is about. It is mine not to
question why, mine not to make reply, mine
simply to go on doing what my hand finds to
do&mdash;of which there is quite enough at present.
Meanwhile, everybody else is having a nice
easy time, while I am laboring like six dray-horses
for the general good. Hartman sits
about with Jane, and they seem to be getting
on finely. Mabel also appears to enjoy his
society. Sometimes she looks at me and at
Clarice, and then at Jim, in a way which
might indicate a notion that things are too
much mixed, and that the Princess ought to
be giving her attention to Hartman's case. I
think so too, but it is not for me to suggest it.
I feel like asking Mrs. T. what all these complications
mean, and why she does not
straighten them out: she is Clarice's relative
and hostess, and head of the house when I am
away. But it will straighten itself pretty soon
now, and a new tangle will begin for the predestined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
victim. Wild man of the woods,
your hour will soon strike, and the grim executioner
in the black mask will prepare to take
your head off. You will see a hand not clearly
visible to the outside world&mdash;a very beautiful
hand it is too, as I ought to know&mdash;that will
beckon you to your doom: you will hear a
voice whose silvery music will drown all fears,
all scruples, all world-sick longings for your
woman-hating moods, all memories of your
lost Lenore of long ago, and tell you that
resistance and delay are vain. What the
details of the process may be, and whether joy
or woe will tip the scales for one who takes
things as seriously as you do, I cannot tell;
but it is coming, and it is coming presently.
You may not like it: you are
not used to it as I am; but you cannot
help yourself. Farewell to the old life,
the old delusions, the old fancied knowledge:
you will find yourself a small boy in primary
school, beginning the world anew. You think
you are locked up in steel, defended by your
indifference, your disgust, your unbelief in
Life. These glittering generalities will fall
into dust before the wand of a magician who
has some eminently particular business with
you. You have sounded the depths, and
found them shallow; you have tested values,
and they are less than nothing, and vanity;
you have emptied the pincushion, and only
bran is there. My skeptical friend, a sharp
needle is there yet, and it will prick your finger:
there are depths that you know nothing
about, and heights too, it may be: there are
thrills of life that will go through all your
veins, and show you that you are not as near
dead as you supposed. You were but a boy
when that girl gave you your quietus, as you
imagined; you are a man now, with more in
you than you fancy, and another girl may
bring you to life. Still in your ashes live
their ancient fires, and I'm mistaken if they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
don't start a superior blaze before long. Well,
well, I hope it will make a man of you.</p>

<h3><a name="On_the_Cliffs" id="On_the_Cliffs"></a>X.</h3>

<h4>ON THE CLIFFS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> betrayed into the above apostrophe
by the violence of my sympathies; but the
lucid and graphic sentences which precede
this moralizing ably sum up the situation during
the first week of Hartman's visit. A good
deal of wisdom was in circulation: I said
some things myself which deserve to be
remembered, and the others occasionally dropt
a remark which showed how the ball was
moving. You will want the chief of these
outpourings in order of time, as landmarks in
this history.</p>

<p>Clarice took me apart the first day and
began to cross-examine me: that is, she told
me to go outside and wait for her, and by
the time she came it was dusk. Why is it
that the garish day seems to freeze our finer
emotions, and reduce us to the monotonous level
of a dull cold practicality? It is under the
calm light of moon and stars that soul speaks
to soul, and we gain those subtler experiences,
those deeper views of our own nature and that
of our nearest and dearest, which so far transcend
the plodding sciences of the laboratory,
the useless learning of the pedant, and the
empty wisdom of the children of this world.</p>

<p>"Come, Robert, wake up; don't sit mooning
there like a calf. Make your report."</p>

<p>"Report?" said I, thus rudely startled from
a train of thought which might have borne
rich fruit for coming generations. "What
about?"</p>

<p>"What about? You forget yourself.
Whose employ are you in?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"Well, on Water Street I am supposed to be
carrying on business for myself, and at home I
am the envied husband and father of a happy
and admiring family. Clarice, I was meditating
on subjects of much moment; and the
duties of hospitality claim my valuable time.
Did you wish to speak to me particularly?"</p>

<p>"None of your nonsense, now. What did
you talk about last night on the boat?"</p>

<p>"All sorts of things. My conversation is
always improving. I explained to Jim that
his reëntrance on society could not be made
under fairer auspices; that models of deportment
and of all the virtues would be about
him on every hand; that a pure atmosphere
of love and peace pervaded this modest mansion;
that joy was unconfined; that we could
lay our weary heads on each other's bosoms
in the repose of perfect trust, knowing that
not a thought entered any one of them which
the angels above might not look into with
satisfaction, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You talk too much about bosoms, Robert:
it is not in good taste. What did you say
about me?"</p>

<p>"Divil a word, bedad. Wasn't that right?
Didn't you tell me to keep dark, and not
mention you?"</p>

<p>"Not unnecessarily. But didn't he ask?"</p>

<p>"He'd forgotten all about you. Now, Princess,
don't be offended; there was next to nothing
to forget, you know. It's not as if he had
ever seen you, or really heard anything about
you. O, I'll talk you up to him whenever
you say so; to-night, if you like. But I thought
his forgetting was what you wanted. Didn't
I manage it well? Do own that now, please.
Let those cerulean orbs shed one ray of gentle
light upon the path of a weary wayfarer&mdash;yes,
that's better. Have I merited your
approval, Serene Highness?"</p>

<p>"You've done very well&mdash;for you. But
was it necessary to tell so many lies, Bob?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
"Now <i>that</i> is not in good taste, if I am a
judge&mdash;to put such ugly names upon the
graceful fancies with which I decorate the
plain, rude facts of everyday life. What are
we without Imagination, that glorious gift
which causes the desert to rejoice and blossom
like your little flower-bed in the back yard at
home? You know, Clarice, that my mind is
a deep clear well of Truth, and my lips merely
the bucket that draws it up. Where will you
get candor and veracity, those priceless pearls,
if not from me?"</p>

<p>"Robert, you have fallen into this way of
practising your little tricks and deceptions on
everybody. O, I know you mean no harm;
it is merely for your own amusement. But
Mabel and Jane don't quite understand it."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you explain it to them, Clarice?
Some people have no sense of humor. I can't
well go around saying, This is a joke; please
take it in the spirit in which it is offered."</p>

<p>"O, it does no great harm: they are very
seldom deceived, and perhaps they will learn
to make allowances for you by and by. But
you may be tempted to try your games on me:
if I ever catch you at that&mdash;Remember, I am
not to be trifled with."</p>

<p>"Perish the thought, and perish the caitiff
base who would harbor it. Princess, you are
sharper than I. Do you think I would be fool
enough to try any tricks on you, when I
should be found out at once?"</p>

<p>"People generally find you out at once, but
that doesn't seem to stop you. How can I
tell whether I can trust you? I don't believe
you know yourself when you are serious&mdash;if
you ever are."</p>

<p>"There is one subject on which I am serious&mdash;deeply
so, and always. Clarice, when I die,
if you will see that the autopsy is properly performed,
you will find your initials, as the poet
says, neatly engraven on my blighted heart."</p>

<p>"Robert, sometimes I fear you have incipient
softening of the brain."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
"And if I have, is not that a reason why I
should be watched and guarded tenderly&mdash;why
loving arms should enfold my tottering frame,
and sweet smiles cheer my declining path, and
a strong firm brain like yours support my failing
intellect? Clarice, be gentle with me. I am
an orphan like yourself; soon, if you read the
future aright, to be laid beneath the cold clods
of the valley. When I am sleeping under the
daisies in the lonely churchyard, you will say
to yourself, He was my friend, my more than
brother: he loved me with a loyal and self-oblivious
devotion. And then, in those sad
hours of vain remembrance, every unkind
word that you have spoken, all the coldness
and cruelty which have pierced my patient
breast, will return to torture yours. Be
warned in time, Clarice, and make it easy for
me while you have the chance."</p>

<p>"Robert, if you have a talent, it is for shirking
a subject you are afraid of. When you
go off like this, I know you are hiding something
from me. What is it this time?"</p>

<p>I saw things were getting serious. She was
bound to get it out of me, and I might as well
give in. "Princess, I will confess, and throw
myself on your mercy. Strike, but hear me.
It won't pay you to be cross now, for you've
got to be with me till you conclude to take
Hartman up; we can't be quarrelling all the
time, you know. He asked me about you this
morning; Jane had spoken of you at breakfast.
I put him off with general remarks
about your being down south last winter, and
the like of that; then suddenly my brain
slipped&mdash;it <i>is</i> softening, you see&mdash;and I said
you had come back when I was in the woods
with him. That started him, and he recalled
your notion of going up there."</p>

<p>"You are sure you didn't mention it yourself?
What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Merely that he wished I had let you and
Jane come. He likes Jane. Upon my honor
now, he had no suspicion of anything."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
"You goose, how often have I told you
there was nothing to suspect? But men are
so coarse. Well, is that all? What else are
you trying to conceal?"</p>

<p>"On my soul, Princess, that's all. I explained
it all right, and he was commencing
to berate me for not preparing him to meet
you as well as the others, when we suddenly
came on you, and you struck him deaf and
dumb and blind. He swore at me under his
breath just before I introduced him." Here
my feelings overcame me again.</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm done. But you
really must be more careful, Bob. Try and
make your poor mind work better while it
lasts; don't forget my instructions again, and
when you have made a blunder, tell me at
once. You are so light, so devoted to your
frivolous amusements; you seem to be drifting
into second childhood, thirty years too soon.
If you had an object, now, a serious purpose
in life: if you really cared for anything&mdash;even
for me!"</p>

<p>She cuts me when she talks like that.
"Clarice, my regard for you is so undemonstrative
that you fail to appreciate its depth.
If I were to make a fuss over it, now, and use
a lot of endearing epithets and big professions,
perhaps you would believe me. Some time
you will know whether I care for you or not;
whether I've got anything in me, and am
capable of acting like a man. You wait and
see. But I wish I knew what you are going
to do with poor Jim."</p>

<p>"Some time you will know: you wait and
see. You can go and comfort him now. Good
night, poor Bob."</p>

<h3><a name="Explanations" id="Explanations"></a>XI.</h3>

<h4>EXPLANATIONS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> and comforted him. "Well, old
man," I said with a cheerful air, "how do you
get on?"</p>

<p>"Robert," said he, "do you suppose I would
have come here if I had known what an
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'atvocious'">atrocious</ins> humbug you are? Do you imagine
for a moment that my relatives, if I had any,
would have subjected my innocence to such
insidious guardianship? Have you brought
me here to destroy my faith, and pollute my
morals, and poison my young life with the
spectacle of your turpitude?"</p>

<p>"You're improving already, Jim. When I
saw you last you hadn't any faith, nor much
morals; your youth was away back in the
past, and your strength was dried up like railroad
doughnuts; you were ready to fall with
the first leaves of autumn. Well, since you
are here, you can stay till you see how you
like us. What do you think of Clarice?"</p>

<p>"She has given me no basis on which to
think of her, beyond her looks; they rather
take one's breath away. You beast, what do
you mean by springing a face like that on me
without warning, after all your humbugging
talk last night, pretending to post me on every
one I was to meet? And I say, do you always
stand guard over her when anybody comes
near?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, you were so overcome by
the first sight of her this morning, that it
seemed no more than fair to let you recover
your breath, as you say, and get used to her
by degrees. But, James, this is unseemly
levity on your part. What have we to do
with girls? Let us leave them to the baser
spirits who have use for them. The world's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a bubble, and the life of man of no account at
all. We have tried it, and it is empty; hark,
it sounds. Vain pomp and glory of it all, we
hate ye. Ye tinsel <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'gands'">gauds</ins>, ye base embroideries,
ye female fripperies, have but our scorn.
What are flashing eyes, and tossing ringlets,
and rosy lips, and jewelled fingers, to minds
like ours? Let us go off to the Nitrian desert,
Jim, away from this eternal simper, this harrowing
routine."</p>

<p>"You must have been reading up lately,
my boy. I left all that in the woods, Bob,
and came down here in good faith for a change
of air, prepared to learn anything you might
have to teach me. If you've got any more
traps and masked batteries, let them loose on
me; practice on me to your heart's content.
You've undertaken to convert me, and I'm
here to give you a chance: a fine old apostle
you are. But I don't quite understand Miss
Elliston's position here, Bob."</p>

<p>"Her position here, or anywhere else, is
that she does about as she pleases, and makes
everybody else do it too, as you will see before
your hair is gray, my learned friend. As I
may have told you, we are her nearest relatives:
she is an orphan."</p>

<p>"Parents been dead long?"</p>

<p>"About seventeen years. What's that got
to do with it?"</p>

<p>"O, not much; don't be so suspicious. Do
you think I'm trying to play some trick on
you, after your model? How should I, a helpless
stranger in a strange land, betrayed by
the friend in whom I trusted? I'm an orphan
myself too. So that Miss Elliston is in a
measure dependent on your kindness?"</p>

<p>"O, don't fancy that she's a poor relation,
or anything of that sort. She's got more cash
than she wants, and loads of friends: had
twenty invitations for the summer. If you
don't behave to suit her, she's liable to go off
any day to Bar Harbor, or Saratoga, or the
Yosemite, or Kamtchatka."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
"Very good of her, to stay here with you,
then."</p>

<p>"Well, Mabel is deeply attached to her; so
is Jane, and the children of course. Her
parents and mine were close friends in the country&mdash;where
I came from, you know. She and
I were brought up together; that is, she was&mdash;I
was mostly brought up before her appearance
on this mundane sphere. We used to play
in the haymow, and fall from the apple trees
together, and all that. O, Clarice is quite a
sister to me&mdash;a pretty good sister too, all things
considered."</p>

<p>"And you are quite a brother to her, as I
see. Strange, that it never
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occured'">occurred</ins> to mention
her, when you were describing the various
members of your family. Does her mind match
her personal attractions?"</p>

<p>"She's got as good a head as you have, old
man, or any other male specimen I've struck.
I myself meet her on almost equal terms. O,
hang that; I don't either. This is no subject
for profane jesting. Talk about the inferiority
of women! If the moralists and stump-speakers
had one like her at home, they'd
change their tune. But there are no more
like her."</p>

<p>"You speak warmly, Bob. To Clarice every
virtue under heaven. Beautiful, brilliant, accomplished,
amiable; you are a happy man to
have such an annex to your household&mdash;even
if she wasn't worth naming at the start."</p>

<p>"Amiable&mdash;who said she was amiable?
Leave that to commonplace women and plain
everyday fellows like me. You can't expect
that of her sort, Jim. She can be very nice
when she pleases. I suppose she has a heart;
it has never waked up yet. When it does, it
will be a big one. We don't expect the
plebeian virtues of her."</p>

<p>"She has a conscience, I hope? If not, it
might be better to go away, and stay away.
You ought not to keep dangerous compounds
about the house, Bob."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
"She won't explode&mdash;though others may.
A conscience? I think so. She couldn't do a
mean thing. She keeps a promise: she has
more sense of justice than most women. But
you can't apply ordinary rules to her. She is
of the blood royal: the Princess, we call her.
Can't you see, Jim? You are man enough to
take her measure, so far as any one can."</p>

<p>"I see her outside; it is worth coming here
to see, if I were an artist or an æsthete. She
has deigned to show me no more as yet."</p>

<p>"It is all of a piece: the rest matches that,
as you will see in time. There is but one
Clarice."</p>

<p>"Bob, you are different from last night. I
believe you are telling the truth now."</p>

<p>"She sobers you. When you have been
with her, when you think of her, it is as if you
were in church&mdash;only a good deal more so."</p>

<p>"Very convenient and edifying, to have
such a private chapel in one's house. Bob, in
this mood I can trust you. Tell me one thing:
why did you never mention her to me?"</p>

<p>"She doesn't wish me to talk of her to
strangers."</p>

<p>"And now the prohibition is removed?"</p>

<p>"You are not a stranger now. She knows
you, and you have seen her."</p>

<p>"Well, you are loyal. Does she appreciate
such fidelity?"</p>

<p>"We are very good friends. From childhood
we have been more together than most
brothers and sisters. More or less, I have
always been to her as I am now. She is used
to me. I do not ask too much of her. Don't
fancy that I am in her confidence, or any one:
she has a royal reserve. See here, Jim; I am
making you one of the family."</p>

<p>"I understand. I must ask you one thing:
why did you bring me here, to expose me to
all this?"</p>

<p>"You needed a change, Jim, as you half
owned just now; almost any change would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
for the better. I wanted you to see the world
again: there is in it nothing fairer or richer
than Clarice."</p>

<p>"You go on as if she were a saint; and yet
you say she's not."</p>

<p>"You can answer that yourself, Jim. She's
far from it: you and I are not saint-worshippers.
But she has it in her to be a saint, if her attention
and her latent force were turned that
way. She can be anything, or do anything.
She hasn't found her life yet. She bides her
time, and I wait with her. Her wings will
sprout some day. I like her well enough as
she is."</p>

<p>"Evidently. Do you know, old man, that
you are talking very freely?"</p>

<p>"Am I the first? or do you suppose I would
say all this to any chance comer? You
opened your soul to me in May, as far as you
knew it: you are welcome to see into mine
now."</p>

<p>"There is a difference. I cared for nothing,
and believed in nothing; so my soul was worth
little. Yours is that of a prosperous and
happy man."</p>

<p>"Externals are not the measure of the soul,
Jim, nor yet creeds. I know a gentleman when I
see him, and so do you. Your soul will get its
food yet, and assume its full stature; you've
been trying to starve it partly, that's all."</p>

<p>"Do you talk this way to your Princess,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"No. She is younger than we: why should
I bore her? You and I are on equal terms:
she and I are not."</p>

<p>"This <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'humilty'">humility</ins> is very chivalric, but I don't
quite understand it in you, Bob."</p>

<p>"You can't: you've been so long unused to
women, and you never knew one like her. If
you had, it would have been too early; what
does a boy of twenty know of himself, or of
the girls he thinks he is in love with, or of the
true relations that should exist between him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and them? Call it quixotic if you like; I
don't mind. Any gentleman, that is, any
spiritual man, has it in him to be a Quixote.
When you come to know Clarice, you will
understand."</p>

<p>"Do you call yourself and me spiritual men,
Bob?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why not? Spirituality does not depend
on the opinions one chances to hold, but
on the view he takes of his own part in Life, and
on the inherent nature of his soul. We are
not worshippers of mammon, or fashion, or any
of the idols of the tribe. I live in the world,
and you out of it; but that makes little difference.
You were in danger of becoming a
dogmatist, but you are too much of a man for
that. We both live to learn, and we can spend
ourselves on an adequate object when we
find it."</p>

<p>"Bob, if you don't talk to her like this, she
doesn't know you as I do."</p>

<p>"No human being knows another exactly as
a third does. We strike fire at different points&mdash;when
we do at all, which is seldom&mdash;and
show different sides of ourselves to such few as
can see at all. She does not care especially for
me: why should she? But she has great
penetration&mdash;more than you have, far more
than I. She sees my follies and faults as you
don't; she is a sort of a confessor. At
present she is a Sunday-school teacher, and
I am her class."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you talk of, all the time?"</p>

<p>"It's not all the time, by any means. That
is as she pleases; just now it may be a good
deal. By and by it may be your turn: then
you'll know some things you don't now.
There is nothing I say to her which the world
might not overhear, if the world could understand
it; and nothing that I can repeat. Jim,
I am done: we are up very late."</p>

<p>"Two things I must say yet, or ask, old
man. You would stand by this girl against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the world; and yet you have charged yourself
with me. It may be idle to formulate remote
and improbable contingencies, but it is in our
line. Would you take her part against me,
and be my enemy&mdash;you who are my only
friend?"</p>

<p>"I would stand by her against the world,
assuredly. I would stand by you against all
the world but her, I think. You two might
quarrel, but neither of you would be wrong:
I know you both, and you don't know each
other. So I take the risk; it is none. When
that time comes, neither of you will find me
wanting."</p>

<p>"I believe it. The other thing is this&mdash;forgive
me if I go too far. Do you know what
even intelligent and charitable people would
say of all this? That it was very queer, very
mixed, very dubious."</p>

<p>"They are not our judges, nor we theirs.
What would they say of your theories, and
your way of life? To be sure, these concern
yourself alone. So is this inwardly my affair;
it binds, it holds no other. Must a man live
in the woods, to form his own ethical code?
Here too one may keep clean hands and a
pure heart, and do his own thinking. Life is
very queer, very mixed, very dubious; I take
it as it comes. O, I see truth here and there
in your notions of it, though it has done well
by me. If I find in it something unique and
precious, shall I thrust that aside, because the
statutes have not provided for such a case?
But one thing I can reject, so that for me it is
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: not; with a semi-colon">not</ins>: the baser element. Gross selfishness and
vulgar passions are no more in my scheme
than in yours: if their suggestions were to
rise, it would be easy to disown them. The
human beasts who let their lower nature rule,
the animals who care for themselves and call
it caring for another, are not of our society.
O yes, in common things one must get and
keep his own&mdash;the body must have its food;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
but one's private temple is kept for worship,
and owns a different law. It is not always,
nor often, that one can build his shrine on
earth, and enter it every day: when a man
has that exceptional privilege, he must and
may keep his standards high enough to fit.
You understand?"</p>

<p>"I do: I am learning. I knew all this in
theory, but supposed it ended there. And
your Princess, you think is of our society?"</p>

<p>"No root of nobleness is lacking in her;
when the season comes, the plants will spring
and the garden bloom. But we cannot expect
to understand her fully; she is of finer clay
than we."</p>

<p>"One thing more, and then I will let you
go. There is more of you than I thought, my
boy. In May I knew you had a heart; but
one who heard you in the woods would have
set you down just for a kindly, practical man
of the world. Last night, and most of the
time to-day, you were the trifler, the incorrigible
jester. Why do you belie yourself so
and hide your inmost self from all but me?"</p>

<p>"Because I've got to convert you, old man.
It is a poor instrument that has but a single
string; and David's harp of solemn sound
would bore me as much as it would other folks,
if I tried to play on it all the time. How
many people would sit out this talk of ours,
or read it if we put it in print? Taken all in
all, the light fantastic measure suits me much
better. To see all sides, we must take all
tones. The varying moods within fit the
varying facts without; to get at truth we must
give each its turn. But in the main it is best
to take Life lightly. Your error was that
you were too serious about it: it's not worth
that. Most things are chiefly fit to laugh at.
The highgrand style will do once in a way:
we've worked it too hard now. Let's come
down to earth. I wanted to show you that I
could do the legitimate drama as well as you,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and yet wear a tall hat and dress for dinner.
See?"</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Bob, but I can discriminate
between your seriousness and your
farce. Perhaps it is well to mix them, or to
take them as they are mixed for us. You may
be right in that; I'll think it over. Yes, I
can see now that Heraclitus overdoes it, and
that I used to. Well, my lad, you are a queer
professor of ethics; but I'm not sure you've
brought me to the wrong school."</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Awakening" id="Awakening"></a>XII.</h3>

<h4>AWAKENING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Clarice took me off as usual.
"Well, have you made any more blunders?"</p>

<p>"Not one. You have nothing to reproach
me with this time, Czarina."</p>

<p>"You kept Mr. Hartman up dreadfully late.
What were you talking about so long?"</p>

<p>"O, he is prepared to find you wonderful,
and to come to time whenever you want him.
I told him your wings weren't grown yet: you
were the Sleeping Beauty in the Enchanted
Palace; the hour and the man hadn't arrived.
You dwelt in maiden meditation, and the rest
of it."</p>

<p>"You did not cheapen me, surely, Robert?"</p>

<p>"God forbid: do I hold you cheap, that I
should rate you so to others? He may tell
you every word I said, when you begin to turn
him inside out; there was none of it that you
or I need be ashamed of. He knows, both by
his own observation and from my clear and
impressive narrative, that you are remote and
inaccessible&mdash;the edelweiss growing high up in
its solitude, where only the daring and the
elect can find its haunt."</p>

<p>"That is very neat. Did it take you three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
hours to tell him that? I heard you come in
as it struck two."</p>

<p>"Too bad to disturb your slumbers, Princess:
we will take our boots off outside, next time.
Naturally you were the most important topic
we could discuss; but I also explained his
advantages in being thrown so much into my
own society. O, he is getting on. He said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to know what he said. The
man is here, and I can see&mdash;and hear, when I
choose&mdash;for myself. Do you think I would
tempt you to violate what might be a confidence,
Robert?"</p>

<p>"But if I repeat to you what I said, why
not what he said?&mdash;except that his observations
would not be so powerful and suggestive
as mine, of course. Otherwise I don't see the
difference."</p>

<p>"Now that is stupid, Bob. The difference
is that you belong to me, and he doesn't&mdash;as
yet."</p>

<p>I can't tell you how she says these things.
If I could put on paper the tone, the toss of
that lovely head, the smile, the sparkle of eyes
and lips, that go with what you might call
these little audacities, then you would know
how they not only accent and punctuate the
text, but supply whole commentaries on it.
If you get a notion that the Princess is capable
of boldness, or vulgar coquetry, or any of the
faults of her sex or of ours, you are away off
the track, and my engineering must have gone
wrong. But I must stop this and get back to
my report.</p>

<p>"One thing I must repeat, Princess. I got
off a lot of wisdom for Jim's benefit. You
wouldn't think how wise it was; deep principles
of human nature, and rules for the conduct
of life, and such. It did him no end of
good: and then he said that if I didn't talk to
you that way, you couldn't know me as well
as he does."</p>

<p>"He must know you remarkably well then.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Just like a man's conceit. Poor Bob, who
should know you through and through if I
don't?&mdash;Why don't you talk to me that way
then, and improve me too?"</p>

<p>"As the Scotchwoman said when they asked
her if she understood the sermon, Wad I hae
the presumption? When you catch me taking
on airs and trying to improve you, make
a note of it. No, no, Princess dear; the
lecturing and improving between us had
better remain where they are."</p>

<p>"But, Robert, perhaps I would like to have
you vary this continual incense-burning with
snatches of something else."</p>

<p>"I dare say. Do you know, Clarice, sometimes
I think I am an awful fool about you."</p>

<p>"That is what the doctors call a congenital
infirmity, my dear. No use lamenting over
what you can't help. Worship me as much
as you like; it keeps you out of mischief. But
you might change the tune now and then, and
give me some of your alleged wisdom."</p>

<p>"Shall I becloud that pure and youthful
brow with metaphysic fumes? Should I soil
your dainty muslins with the antique dust of
folios, and oil from the midnight lamp? You
wait till you take up Hartman; perhaps you
can stand it from him. But if I were to hold
forth to you in the style he prefers, you would
get sick of me in twenty minutes. Let it
suffice that my lonely vigils are spent in severe
studies and profound meditations, the fruit
whereof, in a somewhat indirect and roundabout
way, may make smooth and safe the
path that is traversed by your fairy feet. In
the expressive language of the poet, Be happy;
tend thy flowers; be tended by my blessing."</p>

<p>"I know about your lonely vigils, Bob;
they are spent on cigars, and making up jokes
to use next morning. But you are not as bad
as usual <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to day'">to-day</ins>. Do you know, I like you
better when you are comparatively serious."</p>

<p>"Then let me be ever thus, my Queen! It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
is the solemnizing influence of being so much
with you. If you keep it up for another week,
you'll have to send me off to New York to
get secularized. I say, Clarice, how long do
you mean to go on in this way? It's all very
nice for me, but how about Hartman? <i>He's</i>
not frivolous; he takes Life in awful earnest.
What do you propose to do with him after
you've got him&mdash;I should say, after the fatal
dart has transfixed his manly form, and he
falls pierced and bleeding at your feet?"</p>

<p>"My dear child, let me tell you a pretty
little tale. Once upon a time there was a
friend of mine, who thought a good deal of me,
and of whom I thought more than he knew,
poor man&mdash;enough to make you jealous, Bob."&mdash;Now
who the devil was that, confound him?
I never heard of him before. It must have
been that winter she spent in Boston, just after
she came out. That's over five years ago;
he's probably dead or married before this.
Well, get on with your pretty little tale: not
that I see much prettiness about it.&mdash;"And
when I would tease him to tell me some secret,
he would answer, in his own well-chosen language.
Some day you will know: you wait
and see. By-by, baby!"&mdash;and away she
dashed.</p>

<p>My tongue went too fast last night. Her
heart <i>is</i> waking; her wings are sprouting.
She must be getting interested in Jim. The
hour is at hand, and the man: the horn at the
castle-gate will soon be sounded, and presto!
the transformation scene. That will be a
spectacle for gods and men, now; but no
tickets will be sold at the doors&mdash;admittance
only by private card, and that to a very select
few. I don't want any change in you, Princess;
but I suppose the angels would like to
see the depths in you that you haven't
sounded, the fairer and wider chambers of
your soul opened to the light. God grant
that light may need no darkness to come before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
it, no storm-tossed, doubtful daybreak. If
the change is for your happiness, no matter
about us. You are moving toward a land
where I cannot follow you; a land of mystery
and wonder and awakening, of new beauties
and glories and perils, and possibilities unknown
and infinite&mdash;a journey wherein you
can have no guide but your own pure instincts,
no adviser but your own untried heart. God
be with you, for Jane and Mabel can do no
more than I. We shall hear no word from
you till all be over, and then the Clarice of
old will return to us no more. Transfigured
she may be and beatified, but not the one we
knew and loved so long. Little sister, all
these years I have been at your side or ready
at your call, and now you will not call and I
cannot come to help you; for in these matters
the heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a
stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy.
May it be joy and not the other! God be
with them both, for it is a dangerous country
where they are going; a region of mists and
pitfalls and morasses, where closest friends
may be rudely severed, and those whom
Heaven hath joined be put asunder by their
own most innocent errors&mdash;and the finest
spirits run the heaviest risk. Ah well, if I
were the Grand Duke of Gerolstein, maybe
things would be better managed in my dominions.</p>

<h3><a name="Domestic_Criticisms" id="Domestic_Criticisms"></a>XIII.</h3>

<h4>DOMESTIC CRITICISMS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Hartman</span> has made a first-rate impression
here. It would please you to see this stern
ascetic, this despiser of Life and Humanity,
with two toddlers on his lap, and Herbert at
his knee, all listening open-mouthed to tales
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The
boy thinks that one who lives in the woods
must be a great hunter, and clamors for bears
and wildcats: Jane, in her usual unfeeling
way, insists that I put him up to this. But
though I am a family man&mdash;and you could not
easily find one more exemplary&mdash;I do not propose
to drag the nursery into the cold glare of
public comment, or favor you with a chapter
on the Management of Children.</p>

<p>I would like to know why it is that women
are so ready to take up with any chance
stranger who comes along, when they cannot
see the true greatness of their own nearest
and dearest. Mabel pronounces Hartman a
perfect gentleman and a safe companion for
me; as if it were I, not he, that needed looking
after. Jane seems to regard him as the
rock which withstands the tempest, the oak
round which the vine may safely cling, and
that sort of thing. He is a good-looking fellow
yet, and he has a stalwart kind of bearing,
adapted to deceive persons who do not know
him as well as I do. They would almost side
with him against Clarice&mdash;but not quite: in
their hearts, they think her perfect.</p>

<p>One evening we were all together in the
parlor. The Princess had gone somewhere
with one of her numerous adorers, whom she
had failed to bluff off as she generally does:
the young man was going to cast himself into
the sea, I believe, and I told her she had better
let him and be done with it, but she said
he had a widowed mother and several sisters,
and ought to live long enough to leave them
comfortably provided for; so I let her go. I
was trying to direct the conversation into improving
channels, but the frivolous female
mind is too much for me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hartman," Jane began, "we rely on
you to exercise a good influence upon Robert.
He is so light-minded, and so deceitful."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mabel added; "no one can restrain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
him but Clarice, and she cannot spend her
whole time upon him, she has so much else
to do."</p>

<p>"See here," said I; "this is a put-up job:
I will have you all indicted for conspiracy.
Have you no proper respect for the head of
the house?"</p>

<p>"We would like to," my spouse replied:
"we make every effort: but it is so difficult!
Mr. Hartman, he wants to manage every little
matter, particularly those which pertain exclusively
to women, and which he cannot
understand at all."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jane; "would you believe it,
Mr. Hartman, he attempted to instruct us as
to the proper manner of receiving you! But
that is not the worst of it. He is utterly
unable to keep a secret&mdash;not that any one
would entrust him with secrets of the least
importance, of course. And when he thinks
he knows something that we do not know, he
goes about looking so solemn that even Herbert
can detect him at once. And in such
cases he actually comes to us, and questions
us about the matter, with a view to throwing
us off the scent, and keeping dark, as he calls
it. Did you ever hear of such absurdity?"</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentleman," I said with dignity,
"would you mind excusing me for a few moments?
I would like to retire to the rocks
outside, and swear a bit."</p>

<p>"Robert!" my wife cried, "I am ashamed
of you. What will Mr. Hartman think of
your morals?" You see, they think Jim is a
very correct young man.</p>

<p>"O, I know him of old," he said. "Never
mind, Bob, I will stand by you. Really, you
are a little hard on him. He has improved;
I assure you he has. Why, he was quite a
cub at college. Your softening influences have
done a great deal for him; everything, in
fact."</p>

<p>"It is very nice in you to say so, Mr. Hartman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and very polite, and very loyal; but I
know Robert. Clarice does him a little good:
she would do very much more, if he were not
so stiff-necked. He thinks he is a man, and
we are only women."</p>

<p>"Well," I asked, "are you going to dispute
that proposition? If so, I will leave Hartman
to argue it out with you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hartman," said Jane, "he thinks he
knows everything, and women are inferior
creatures. O, such a superior being as he is!"</p>

<p>"This is getting monotonous," I remarked.
"Suppose, for a change, we abuse Clarice, as
she is not here; that will be pleasanter all
round, and less unconventional. Now that
girl does a great deal of harm, turning the
heads of so many foolish young men. She
spends more on her dress than you and I do
together, Hartman. What an aim in life for
a rational being! Simply to look pretty, and
produce an occasional piece of perfectly idle
and useless embroidery: tidies even, now and
then&mdash;just think of it! Of all the&mdash;"</p>

<p>My wife stopped me here, and I was glad of
it, for I really did not know what to say next.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Robert.
To speak in that way of my cousin, and your
own adopted sister! Don't believe a word of
it, Mr. Hartman. She is sweet girl, though
reserved with strangers: I am sorry you have
seen so little of her. A high-minded, pure-hearted,
dear, sweet, lovely girl; she is, and
you know it, Robert." Well, perhaps I do;
but there is no need of my saying so just now.
Jane has to put in her oar again, of course.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hartman, and that is a sample
of his hypocrisy. He thinks as highly of
Clarice as we do, and is almost as fond of her;
and yet he pretends to criticize her, just to
draw away attention from his own shortcomings."</p>

<p>"Well, let's drop Clarice then, and go on
discussing the present company, if you insist.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
We'll take them up one by one: I've had my
turn, and my native modesty shrinks from
further praise. You see Mrs. T., Hartman?
She sits there looking so calm and placid, like
a mother in Israel; you would think her a
model spouse. Yet no one knows what I
suffer. Mabel, I had not been with him ten
minutes last May when he noticed my premature
baldness, and general fagged-out and
jaded look; and to hide the secrets of my
prison-house, I had to pretend that I had been
working too hard in Water Street. You all
know how painful deception is to my candid
nature; but I did it for your sake, Mabel.
When did I ever return aught but good for
evil? Yet O, the curtain lectures, the manifold
ways in which the iron has entered into
my soul! But we brought Hartman here to
reconcile him to civilized and domestic life,
and I will say no more. Now there is Jane.
She naturally puts her best foot foremost in
company; you think she is all she seems: but
I could a tale unfold. Now mark my magnanimity:
I won't do it. She is my sister,
and with all her faults I love her still. Well,
if you <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'are are'">are</ins> tired you'd better go to bed:
Hartman wants to smoke."</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Over_two_Cigars" id="Over_two_Cigars"></a>XIV.</h3>

<h4>OVER TWO CIGARS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we got out under the pure breezes of
heaven, Hartman turned to me and said, "So
you call this reconciling me to domestic life,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to see things as they are.
They are not as bad as your fancy used to
paint them, or as a duller man might suppose
from recent appearances. Women haven't
our sense of humor, Jim: their humble efforts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
at jocosity are apt to be exaggerated, or
flat&mdash;generally
both; but they mean no harm."</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, your preparations to instruct
my ignorance are highly successful. All this
is as good as a play. You see you are found
out, old humbug; everybody sees through you.
You can't delude any of us any more."</p>

<p>"I don't quite see what you're driving at,
my christian friend; but I'm glad you like
us, and I hope you'll like us better before you
are done with us." When he talks like this,
I am content to see the hand of Fate snatch at
his scalp, as it will before long. Gibe on,
ungrateful mocker: retribution will soon overtake
you in your mad career. Where then
will be your gibes, your quips, your quiddities?
You'll want my sympathy by and by,
and I'll see about giving it.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so much cast down, Bob.
Perhaps you are building me up better than
you know. Your struggles with your womankind
give a flavor to what I used to suppose
must be insipid. You are pretty well satisfied
with each other, or you wouldn't pretend to
quarrel so. What I saw of you before did
something toward reconciling me to human
nature at large, and your quaint efforts at
shrewdness and finesse set off your real
character. You might take in outsiders, but
not me."</p>

<p>"This is too much, my friend&mdash;a blanked
sight too much. Crushed to earth by such
unmerited compliments, I can only repeat
my gratification that we meet with your approval.
You settle down, and you'll see how
insipid it is: then you'll be making some
quaint efforts at shrewdness and finesse yourself.
Invite me then, and I'll get even with
you, old man. But I say, what did you mean
about my being a cub at college?"</p>

<p>"Well, you were, you know. Barmaids and
ballet-dancers, and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Confound you, Hartman, what do you go
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
bringing them up for? There was only one
of each, or thereabouts, and they were generally
old enough to be my mothers. I was but
a child, Jim&mdash;a guileless, merry, high-hearted
boy, and innocent as the lamb unshorn."</p>

<p>"You were that, and the shearing did you a
lot of good. O, you can be easy; I'll not
bring up the sins of your youth."</p>

<p>"They were no sins, only follies. I had my
early Pendennis stage, of course, and invested
every woman I met with the hues of imagination.
But Mabel and the girls might not understand
that."</p>

<p>"I don't think they would. Happily, it is
not necessary they should try to, since you
have returned to the path of rectitude. Do
you think you belonged to Our Society in those
days, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir: I did, in embryo. I had it in me
to develop into the ornament of our species
you behold at present. That's all a boy is
good for, anyway. He thinks he's somebody,
but he isn't. He doesn't amount to anything,
except in the fond hopes of his anxious
parents. He knows nothing, and he can do
nothing, except learn by his blunders; and
some of 'em can't do that. But if he has any
stuff in him, he grows and ripens with time,
as you and I did. What bosh, to put the
prime of life at twenty-five. They ought to
move it on a bit; about our age, now, a man
ought to be at his best."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Bob. I was an egregious
ass at twenty-five, and I'm not sure I'm any
better now."</p>

<p>"Then there's hope of you, my boy. But
one must go on getting experience. You shut
the door too soon and too tight, Jim."</p>

<p>"When I had it open, such an infernal
stench and dust came in, that it seemed best
to close it. But it's open again now, partly,
and this seems a healthier and cleaner atmosphere."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
"You'll come out all right, Jim; and when
you do, you won't seem to have been altogether
wrong all these years. You've kept
yourself unspotted from the world, more than
most of us; and when you come to know a
girl like Clarice, you'll want the most and
best of you, to be fit for her society. If only
one could get the general ripening without
some of the dashed details of the process!
She makes you wish you could have been
brought up in a bandbox, if only you could
have come out of it a man and not a mollycoddle."</p>

<p>"Only 'men-maidens in their purity' are
worthy to approach her, no doubt. Apparently
I am not. I'll have to be content with
your account of Miss Elliston's perfections,
Robert. She seems to have no more use for
me than the Texans for the Sheriff. But I am
doing very nicely, thanks to your sister. I
doubt if you appreciate Miss Jane, Bob. She
sees further into things than you do. She impresses
me as a sound-hearted woman, wise,
kind, and gracious."</p>

<p>"Yes, and so sisterly and appreciative. O
yes, such a superior person as she is! But
see here, Jim; that's not what you're here for.
Jane is all very well in her way, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned on me suddenly. "What the
deuce do you mean now?"</p>

<p>By Jove, now I've done it: he's got me in a
corner.&mdash;You just wait and see me get out of
it. "O well, Jim, I speak only by general
analogy, of course. I am not in the Princess's
confidence, as I told you. I might be if any
one were, but nobody can see into her mind
further than she chooses to let them, and that
is but a very little way. It would be a fine
sight, no doubt; but she has the reticence of
a&mdash;well, of an angel probably; exceptionally
delicate and sensitive nature, and all that, you
know. It's not her way to let a good thing
go by unnoticed, and she is quite able to appreciate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
you. Your time is not up yet: you're
likely to see more of her before you go&mdash;at
least, I should suppose so."</p>

<p>"Well, I am here to see things, as you say,
and I may as well see whatever is to be shown
me. I am in your hands, old man; make as
good a job of it as you can before you send
me back to the woods."</p>

<p>It is all very well for him to talk lightly on
solemn subjects; he'll change his tone by and
by. I have prepared his mind now, as I prepared
the others before he came. Perhaps I
ought to have done it sooner; perhaps the
Princess has been waiting for that. She'll
know, without my telling her; she'll see it in
his eye.&mdash;Nonsense, Robert T.; your zeal outruns
your discretion. What does she want of
your help in a thing like this? Anyway, he's
ready to be operated on, and it seems about
time she began to put in her work.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Catastrophe" id="The_Catastrophe"></a>XV.</h3>

<h4>THE CATASTROPHE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> miscellaneous entertainment, as I have
remarked, lasted for about a week: then suddenly
the situation changed. I can't tell you
how it was done, though I was looking on all
the time; but one evening I found myself with
Jane, and Hartman had gone off with the
Princess. We were all ready to play to her
lead, no doubt; but it would have made no
difference if it had been otherwise: when she
ordains a thing, that thing is done, and without
her taking any pains about it either, so
far as you can see. I think the predestined
victim was pleased and flattered to have the
sacrificial chapter placed upon his head, so to
speak; he ought to have been, at any rate.</p>

<p>"Jane," I said, "what do you suppose
Clarice is up to now?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"Robert," said she, "I thought I had given
you a lesson about practising your absurd
hypocrisies on me. Who should know what
her plans are, if not you? If you really are
not in her confidence&mdash;and it would not be
far, certainly&mdash;surely you know Clarice well
enough not to interfere. Let them alone, and
keep quiet." That is the way they always
talk to me: I wish they would find something
new to say.</p>

<p>Things went on in this fashion for another
week or more. It was all very quiet: there
was really nothing to see. What they talked
about I don't know; when the rest of us were
by, their conversation was not notable. I can
make more original and forcible remarks myself;
in fact, I do, every day. But I have no
doubt she catechized and cross-examined him
in private. It is not Hartman's way to air his
theories before ladies, or to obtrude himself as
a topic of discussion; but the Princess, when
she condescends to notice a man at all, likes to
see a good deal further into his soul than he
ever gets to see into hers. That is all right in
this case; the doctor has to be acquainted
with the symptoms before he can cure the
patient. When Hartman and I were together
at the end of the evenings and at odd hours,
he had very little to say: he seemed rather
preöccupied and introspective. He is another
of your plaguedly reserved people, who when
they have anything on hand wrap it up in
Egyptian darkness and Cimmerian gloom.
That is the correct thing in a woman&mdash;in
Clarice at least: in a man I don't like it. My
soul, now, is as open as the day, and when I
have struck any new ideas or discoveries, I
would willingly stand on a house-top&mdash;if it
were flat&mdash;and proclaim them for the benefit of
the world. Even my uncompleted processes
of thought are at the service of any one who
can appreciate them; but you can't expect
everybody to be like me. Most men are selfish,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
narrowly engrossed in their small private
concerns&mdash;no generous public spirit about
them. But then Hartman is not used to this
kind of thing, and I suppose it knocks the
wind out of him.</p>

<p>One evening I was by myself in the shrubbery;
it was just dark, but there was a tidy
young moon. I wanted to smoke a pipe for a
change, and so had gone to the most secluded
place I could find, for if Mabel were to hear of
this, Hartman might not get reconciled to
domestic life. I sat there, meditating on the
uncertainty of human affairs: it would do you
more good than a little to know what thoughts
passed through my mind, but there is no time
to go into that. Suddenly two forms came
in sight. One was of manly dignity, the other
of willowy grace. His frame towered like the
noble oak on the hilltop, while hers&mdash;but we
have had the oak and the vine before,
and worked them for all they are worth.
Perhaps I ought to have given you a more
particular account of the appearance of these
two young persons: but you don't care to
know their exact height and fighting weight,
the color of their hair and eyes, and so forth;
what you want is the stature and complexion
of their souls. They were a handsome pair,
and whene'er they took their walks and drives
abroad like Dr. Watts, they attracted much
attention. Just now there was nobody but
myself to admire them, and I was in ambush.
They strolled about in what there was of the
moonlight, seeming much absorbed, and I sat
still in the shade, and put down my pipe: I
couldn't hear their talk, and didn't want to
disturb them. Suddenly he raised his voice:
matters between them must have come to an
interesting stage. "But, Clarice, if you care
for me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was too quick. The madness which
urged him on can easily be understood and&mdash;except
by the one concerned&mdash;pardoned; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
what devil possessed her, who shall say? She
drew herself up with superb scorn. "You are
beginning at the wrong end, Sir. 'If I care
for you!' Why should I?"</p>

<p>"Very good," he said at once. "I was
mistaken. I beg your pardon most humbly."</p>

<p>There was as little humility as possible in
his look and tone. He stood like a gladiator&mdash;and
not a wounded one either&mdash;with his head
thrown back and his chest out. I could fancy,
rather than see, the flashing of his eyes.</p>

<p>The flashes were all on his side now;
Clarice's brief exhibition of fireworks seemed
to be over, and she was drooping. "Mr. Hartman,"
she began, and could get no further.</p>

<p>In <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: 'the' does not appear in the original">the</ins> act to go, he turned and faced her again.</p>

<p>"Miss Elliston, my presumption was doubtless
unpardonable; I shall not know how to
forgive myself. Do me the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'underserved'">undeserved</ins> honor,
if you can, to forget it&mdash;and me. I can only
renew my apologies, and relieve you of my
presence."</p>

<p>He bowed, and was gone. The proper
thing for Clarice to do next was to swoon or
shriek; but I knew her too well to expect anything
of that sort. Nor did she tear her hair,
or beat her breast, or offer to the solitary
spectator any performance worth noting.
I thought it best to keep remarkably quiet in
my corner till she too had gone. In fact, I staid
there for an hour or two after, though I did
not enjoy that pipe at all; the tobacco was not
right, or something. You see, after all the
lectures I had had, I did not want to spoil
things by mixing myself up with them; the
situation looked picturesque enough without
me in it.</p>

<p>When I went back to the house I found
that Jim had caught the boat and gone. "He
came to me," said Mabel, "and told me that
he had overstaid his time and found it best to
go to-night. He was very friendly, but his
tone did not encourage questioning or remonstrance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
His parting with Jane was almost
affectionate, and he left kind regards for you.
But not a word for Clarice."</p>

<p>"Great Jackson! what is the matter with
them?" I often use what my wife considers
profane language when I have something to
hide.</p>

<p>It had its effect this time. "Robert, be
quiet. It is all right. When there is anything
for you to know, you shall know it."</p>

<p>She sometimes appears to mistake me for
our eldest boy. But I was glad to get off with the
secret. Yes, there is something to know, my
lady, and I know it, though you don't. But I
fear it is a long way from all right.</p>

<h4>FEMININE COUNSELS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this there was general gloom <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'about about'">about</ins>
the place, and I preferred to spend much
of the time in New York. But whenever I
got there, this confounded <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'buisness'">business</ins> would
drive me back: Clarice might want me. Nobody
dared question her, till one day at lunch
Herbert spoke up. "Mamma, why doesn't
Mr. Hartman come back? Cousin Clarice,
what have you done to him?" He was
promptly suppressed, and the Princess froze
his infant veins with a stony stare, while Jane
and I looked hard at our plates. But later
that day I came upon Clarice and the child
together: he was locked in her arms, and
begging her not to cry. They did not see me,
and I retired in good order.</p>

<p>Within a week came a short note from Jim:
apologies for leaving without saying good-bye
to me, appreciation of our kindness, regards
to my wife and sister&mdash;and not a word of
Clarice. I took it to Mabel, of course.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
"Be very careful how you answer this now,
Robert."</p>

<p>"How will this do? 'Dear Jim, sorry you
went off in such a hurry; but after my performance
in May I have no right to find fault. We
all miss you, I think: the house has grown
dull. Herbert continues to fall over the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'bannisters'">banisters</ins>,
and at intervals over the rocks: at all
hours, but especially when laid up for repairs,
he howls for you and bear-stories. Our kindest
regards. Keep us posted.' That's about it,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es: you can't ask him to come back, and
you can't mention Clarice; so you can say no
more, and I don't like you to say any less.
That is very well&mdash;for you, Robert; though
you need not be so unfeeling about your own
son."</p>

<p>It is well occasionally to consult your womankind
in such cases, because, though they may
not know as much of the facts as you do, still
they can sometimes give you an inner light on
points you would not have thought of. Besides,
it compliments and encourages them;
whereas, if you appeared to pay no regard to
their opinions, they would naturally feel neglected.
A little judicious indirect flattery is
of great use in managing one's household.
So I put on my best air of injured innocence.</p>

<p>"Mabel, I wish you could tell me what is the
matter. Here my guest leaves my house suddenly,
without a word of explanation. Herbert
must be right: what has Clarice done to
him?"</p>

<p>"Robert, I told you that all was well; at least
I trust it will be, though it may not seem so
now. The leaven is working; leave it to Time.
Above all, don't meddle; ask no questions;
leave the matter to those who understand
it."</p>

<p>Now does she mean herself and Jane by
that, or only Clarice and Hartman? I wonder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
if she thinks that I think that she knows anything
about it. If she did, I should catch
some sign of it. I tried my sister.</p>

<p>"Jane, don't fly at me now, please. I am
in trouble."</p>

<p>"So are we all, brother. Trouble not of our
own making&mdash;most of us."</p>

<p>"Well then, what does all this secrecy
mean? Has Clarice spoken to you? What
does Mabel know?"</p>

<p>"She knows no more than you and I,
brother. Something has happened: any one
may suspect what it is, but Clarice will not
tell. I love and respect her too much to ask:
so does Mabel; and so, I hope, do you."</p>

<p>"Well, it's confounded hard lines, Jane, to
have these things happening in your own
house, and such a mystery made of it." I had
to grumble to somebody, you see, if only to
keep up appearances and help hide my guilty
secret; and then I <i>was</i> bored, and worse, with
the way things had gone.</p>

<p>"You took that risk, Robert, when you
brought them together here. Did you expect
that two such persons as they would agree
easily and at once? I think they love each
other, or were in a way to it when this occurred,
whatever it was."</p>

<p>"Well, I am awfully sorry. Clarice can
take care of herself, I suppose; but as for
Hartman, he had load enough to carry before.
I love that man, Jane."</p>

<p>"So do I, Robert."</p>

<p>"Eh? O, the devil you do!" This came
out before I could stop it. It did not please
her.</p>

<p>"Brother, you are simply scandalous. Will
you never learn a decent respect for women&mdash;you
with a wife of your own, and boys growing
up? Where have you been to acquire
such ideas and such manners? You might
have lived in the woods instead of Mr. Hartman,
and he might have been bred in courts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
compared with you.&mdash;I mean, of course, that
I am interested in him, and sorry for him, as
we all are. He is your friend, and he has
excellent qualities."</p>

<p>I was somewhat cast down by all this browbeating.
Where shall a man go for gentle
sympathy and that sort of thing, if not to his
own sister? I suppose she thought of this, for
she went on more kindly. "I would say
nothing to Clarice if I were you. When she
is ready, she will speak&mdash;to you."</p>

<p>"To me, eh? What would she do that for?"
I put this in as part of the narrative, but I
am not proud of it. I had not quite recovered
yet from the effect of Jane's previous violence;
and then my intellect is not equal to all these
feminine convolutions.</p>

<p>"Brother, your head is not as good as your
heart. Don't you understand that in some
cases a woman goes to a man, if there is one
of the right kind at hand, much as a man goes
to a woman? You are a man, and Mr. Hartman's
nearest friend. After all her recent
confidences with you, or intimacy at any rate&mdash;of
course I don't know what she talked with
you about, so many hours&mdash;is it surprising
that Clarice should turn to you in her trouble,
when she can bring herself to break silence
at all? When she is ready, she will speak to
you, and to no one else. Till she is ready,
not all of us together, nor all the world, could
draw a word from her. Must I explain all
this to you, as if you were Herbert? And
when she does speak, brother, I do hope that
you will listen with due respect and sympathy,
and not disgust and repel her by any more
coarse ideas and base interpretations."</p>

<p>I paid no attention to these last remarks,
which seemed to me wholly unworthy of Jane.
Strange, that one who at times displays so
much intelligence and even, as Hartman calls
it, discernment, can in other things be
so unappreciative and almost low-minded.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Coarse ideas, indeed! Well, never mind that
now: let me meditate on this prospect which
she has opened to my view. So Clarice is
coming to me: she knows I am her best
friend after all. Little Clarice, how often have
I dandled her on my knee in the years that
have gone by! Dear little Clarice&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bosh</span>!
What an infernal fool a man can make of
himself over a pretty woman in trouble! I
am sometimes almost tempted to think that,
as she delicately hinted, there must be an
uncommon soft spot in my upper story. It
is bad enough to show it when the girl is by;
let me preserve my balance till then. When
she wants to talk to me, I will hear what she
has to say.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Consolation" id="Consolation"></a>XVII.</h3>

<h4>CONSOLATION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sure</span> enough about a week after this Clarice
came to me as I was smoking a surreptitious
cigar on the rocks, away from the house, after
sundown. She came and sat down close by
me, but I pretended not to notice. "Robert,"
said she. "Well," said I. There is no use
in meeting them half way when they are willing
to come the whole distance: mostly you
have to do it all yourself, and turn about is
fair play.</p>

<p>"Robert, are you angry with me?"</p>

<p>I couldn't help looking at her now, and she
shot one of her great glances into my face.
I melted right down, and so would you have
done. "Clarice, you know I never could be
angry with you five minutes together&mdash;nor
five seconds, if you chose to stop it. What
have I got to be angry about now?"</p>

<p>"Well, Bob, it wasn't your fault this time."</p>

<p>"No, I trust not. Whose fault was it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
"Mine, mine. Bob, will you be my friend?"
And she put her hand in mine.</p>

<p>"What have I ever been but your friend?
Don't you do as you like with me&mdash;and with
all of us? Clarice, you know it hurts me to
see you like this. And there's poor Hartman."</p>

<p>She pulled away from me. "What has Mr.
Hartman to do with it? Who was talking of
him?"</p>

<p>"Miss Elliston," I said with dignity, "the
First of April is past some time ago. What
do you want to be playing these games on me
for?"</p>

<p>"O, don't 'Miss Elliston' me, Bob. Don't
you understand women yet?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll be shot if I do; and I never
expect to. That will do for young beginners,
who think they know everything. I've seen
too much of you to pretend to understand
you. Why don't you speak out and come
straight to the point?"</p>

<p>"Why, you goose, that's not our nature.
Speaking out and going straight to the point
will do for great clumsy things like you and
Mr. Hartman."</p>

<p>"Well, I am a great clumsy thing, as you
justly observe. It's very pleasant to have
you come to me like this, Princess, and I wish
you would do it oftener; it's mighty little I've
seen of you of late. But though it would
meet my views to prolong this session indefinitely,
I suppose you want something of me,
or you wouldn't be so sweet. It may seem
an improbable statement, but I would rather
help you out of this scrape than enjoy your
society even&mdash;that's saying a good deal, but it's
true. Yes, I'm fool enough for that."</p>

<p>"I know you are, dear," she said, very low
and sweetly. Now what was it she knew?
You can take that two ways. All the compliments
I get are so ambiguous. But this did
not occur to me till afterwards. So I went on
with my usual manly simplicity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"Then you know there's no need of circumlocution
and feminine wiles when you want
anything of me, Princess. You have but to
speak, and, as the Frenchman said, 'If it is
possible, it shall be done: if it is impossible,
I can only regret that I can't do it.' What
do you want me to do now?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Bob; nothing but to listen to
me and be good."</p>

<p>"I am listening, Clarice: I've been listening
all this time." This was not quite true, for I
had done most of the talking; but then what I
said was not of much account. When I am
with her I often talk just to fill the gaps.</p>

<p>"You can listen when I am ready to talk,
and keep quiet till then. I only want your
sympathy."</p>

<p>"You have it, Clarice; you have it most
fully. Come rest on this bosom, my own
stricken dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to rest on your bosom, Bob;
your shoulder is big enough. Have you got
your best coat on?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; this is not the one I wore at
dinner. But I will go to the house and get
my clawhammer if you wish."</p>

<p>"No, no. I only want to cry a little."</p>

<p>"You would be perfectly welcome to cry on
my best coat every day of the week, Princess,
and I would get a new one as often as it might
be needed. I don't wish to make capital out
of your grief, my dear; I would rather never
get a kind word from you than have you suffer.
But often it seems as if you didn't care for
anybody, you are so high and mighty and
offish; and O doth not an hour like this make
amends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Drop that, Bob. Don't try to be sentimental:
you always get the lines wrong. I've
not been here an hour. O, were you joking?
You are no more in the humor for jokes than
I am, and you know it. Do keep quiet."</p>

<p>I did: I 'dropped it.' Clarice will use slang
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
at times, it is one of her few faults. Where
she learns it, I cannot conceive. It is unfeminine,
and out of keeping with her whole
character; in any one else I should call it vulgar.
But I saw she did not wish to be disturbed
just then, so I said no more. Instead,
I thought of my guilty secret&mdash;her secret. It
weighs on me heavily; but I can't tell her
what I saw and heard. I don't know how she
would take it; and I don't care to be exploding
any dynamite bombs about my own premises.
The situation is bad enough as it is; I'll not
make it worse. Poor Clarice! poor Hartman!
And yet you can't meddle with such high-strung
folks. By and by she spoke.</p>

<p>"Bob, do you know why I come to you,
instead of to Jane or Mabel?"</p>

<p>I was on the point of quoting Jane's valuable
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: the original is unclear here">idea</ins> about my being a man, but refrained.</p>

<p>"I could not ask any woman for what you
give me. And you are half a woman, Bob;
you are so patient and loyal. Nobody else
would be that."</p>

<p>"But Mabel and Jane love you too, dear.
They would do anything for you."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that is more on equal terms. I
am so exacting; I want so much, and give so
little. I suppose I was born so; and you have
spoiled me&mdash;all of you. O, I know I have
treated you badly, Robert, often; generally,
in fact. I am proud and hateful, and you
never resent it. Only a man can be like that&mdash;to
a woman: and very few men would be
so. You are not like other men, Bob: there
is nobody like you. You are such a useful
domestic animal."</p>

<p>Perhaps I was getting unduly exalted when
she let me down thus. I wish Clarice at least
would be less mixed&mdash;more continuous and
consistent, so to speak&mdash;when she sets forth
my virtues. But one must take the Princess
as he finds her, and be content with any
crumbs of approval she may drop. Sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
I think I am a fool about her; but when she
talks as she does to-night, I know I am not.
There may be more amiable women, and plenty
more even-tempered; but there is only one
Clarice. I may have made that remark before,
but it will bear repeating. It is not
of me she is thinking all this time: how should
it be? O Hartman, Hartman, if you could
know what I know, and see what is before you!</p>

<p>Presently she spoke again. "Robert, why
don't you ask me what I have done? I know
you are dying of curiosity."</p>

<p>"I can restrain my curiosity, rather than
pry into your affairs, dear. When you see
fit, you will tell me. But if you wish it, I will
ask you."</p>

<p>"No, it would be of no use. I can't tell
you now; perhaps never. Robert, where did
you learn to respect a woman so?"</p>

<p>"Jane says I will never learn it. But I do
respect you, Princess."</p>

<p>"That must have been when you had vexed
her with some of your blunders: you do make
blunders, you <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'know' without a question mark">know</ins>? But, Bob, do you know
why I love you?"</p>

<p>This moved me so that I had to put myself
on guard. She never said so much as that
before: it is not her way to talk about feelings
or profess much affection for anybody.</p>

<p>"I suppose because we were brought up
together, and you are used to me. And, as
you say, I am a useful domestic animal. If I
can be useful to you, I am proud and thankful.
I think more of you than I could easily
say: it is very good of you to give me some
small return."</p>

<p>"It is because you have a heart, Robert.
They may say what they please of your head,
but you have a great big heart."</p>

<p>Now was ever the superior male intellect
thus disparaged? She must have got this
notion from Jane; but I can't quarrel with
her now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
"Men are great clumsy things, as you said,
dear: we have not your tact, nor your delicate
roundabout methods. You are right, I do
make blunders; I feel my deficiencies when I
am with you. But if my head, such as it is,
or my heart, or my hand, can ever serve you,
they will be ready."</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to leave you, and go out
of your life?"</p>

<p>"You could not go out of my life, though
you might go far away. I should be sorry,
but I have no right to hold you. But if you
ever wanted me, I should always be here."</p>

<p>"Suppose I did something wrong and foolish?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to suppose that, but if I must&mdash;it
would not be for me to judge you, as you
told me once. You might do something that
did not accurately represent your mind and
character: since I know them, the action
would be merely a mistake, a transient incongruity.
I don't change easily: I have known
you from your cradle. And if it was ever
possible for me to fail you, it is not possible
after to-night."</p>

<p>"You are very fond of Mr. Hartman, Robert.
What if I quarreled with him? Would you
take my part against him?"</p>

<p>"I would take your part against the world,
Clarice. But he is not of the world. A sad
and lonely man, burdened with an inverted
conscience and quixotic fancies that turn the
waters into blood, who has come for once out
of his hermitage to catch a glimpse of the
light that never was on sea or land, and then
to see it turn into darkness for him. I fear
he is sadder and lonelier now than when I
brought him from the woods: but I would
stake my soul on his honor, as I would on
yours. You cannot force me into such a
dilemma."</p>

<p>A heavenly glow was on her face now, as
she looked long at the stars, and then at me.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Why are you eloquent only when you speak
of him, brother?"</p>

<p>"You say I have a heart, Clarice: it is eloquent
when I think of you. Shall a stranger
be more sacred to me than my sister?&mdash;and I
don't mean Jane. You would be sacred to a
better man than I, dear, if he knew you as I
do: you may be so already, for what I can tell.
He <i>could</i> not mean to sin against you, Princess.
If he seemed to fail in respect, or courtesy, or
anything that was your due, forgive him, and
don't banish him forever. I trusted that you
would have enlightened and converted and
consoled him: he is worth it."</p>

<p>I longed to say more, but this was as far as I
dared go. She sighed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I need to be converted and consoled
myself. But that is ungrateful; with such a
comforter at hand I ought not to be miserable.
We never knew each other like this before,
Robert. Why is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Clarice&mdash;or rather I do, of
course. It takes the moon, and stars, and a
common trouble, to bring people together, even
when they see each other every day; and then
concurring moods must help. One stands in
awe of you, Princess; I always shall. You only
tolerated me when you were happy: I was
rough, and careless, and stupid, and made bad
jokes in the wrong places. I will try to do
better after this, so that you need not be repelled
when you want me. Hartman, now, is of
finer mould than I: if you would let him come
back&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of that now, dear. Let us go in.
The moon is going down: it is getting cold
and dark." So it was; and damp too&mdash;on my
shoulder at least. "I am glad you had your
old coat on," she said.</p>

<p>Mabel was alone in the parlor. "Well," she
began; then she saw our faces, and modified
her tone. "The moonlight was very fine, I
suppose?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
"You know you never will go out in the
evening," said Clarice. "It is later than I
thought. Don't scold Robert; he has been a
dear good boy." She kissed her, and went
upstairs.</p>

<p>"Mabel," said I, "Clarice is in trouble." I
had to say something, and this was perfectly
safe. You see, she had told me nothing, and
so I could say if asked. But I wasn't.</p>

<p>"I know that, of course, Robert: I have seen
it all along. She is a dear girl, for all her
flightiness. She will say nothing to me. I
hope it will come right. If you can help or
comfort her, I shall be glad." Then she too
went to bed.</p>

<p>It is unusual for Mabel to be surprised into
such candor. I got a cigar, and went out on
the porch to meditate. Jane thought that
Clarice would tell me things. Yes, I have got
a lot of information. Let me see, I am a
useful domestic animal, and I have a big heart:
that's about the size of it. At this rate, I can
soon write a Cyclopædia. Well, cold facts are
not all there is in life: there are some things
the Cyclopædias fail to tell us about. I don't
regard the last few hours as altogether wasted.</p>

<p>After this the Princess and I did not talk
much: there seemed to be no need of it. But
she was a new and revised edition of the old
Clarice, wonderfully sweet, and gracious, and
equable; and her look when we met was like
the benediction in answer to prayer, as Longfellow
says. I went about with a solemn feeling,
as if I had just joined the Church. What
does a fellow want with slang, and pipes, and
beer, and cheating other fellows on the street,
when he has such entertainments at home?
And yet it cuts me to the soul to look at her: I
<i>must</i> do something to bring them together.
Pretty soon we went back to New York.</p>

<h3><a name="Against_Earnestness" id="Against_Earnestness"></a>XVIII.</h3>

<h4>AGAINST EARNESTNESS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Jane</span>, and even Mabel, have the idea that I
am of light and shallow nature; and sometimes
I think they are right. It must be so; for your
profound and serious characters have a weakness
for sorrow, and luxuriate in woe&mdash;whereas
I object to trouble of any kind, and cannot get
used to it. The house has been like a rural
cemetery for near two months, and it simply
bores me. <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: in the original, Hartman is followed by a comma">Hartman</ins> now prefers to dwell
among the tombs: he has lived these ten years
in a graveyard, so to speak, under a canopy of
funereal gloom, and he thrives on it. He and
Clarice are the most superior persons I know;
and they have gone and got themselves into a
peck, or rather several bushels, of trouble, about
nothing at all. They must like it, or why
should they do it? I doubt if I can ever be
educated up to that point. I have the rude
and simple tastes of a child: sunshine seems
to me better than shade (except during the
heated term), and pleasure more desirable than
pain. I like to be comfortable myself, and to
have every one else so. Imagine Mabel getting
miffed at me, or I at her, over some little two-penny
affair of unadvised expressions! She
often says unkind things to me: if I took an
earnest view of life, and were full of deep
thought and fine feeling, probably I should
have to take her criticisms to heart, and go
away in a hurry and never come back. I sometimes
make blunders worse than that one of
Hartman's, and no harm worth mentioning
ever comes of them&mdash;though I do have to be
careful with the Princess. No doubt I am
frivolous and superficial; but people of my sort
appear to get along more easily, and to make
less trouble for themselves and others, than
those whose standards are so much higher. If
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
I had the managing of this business, I could
set it right inside a week&mdash;or in two days, if
Jim were not so far away. It is merely to say
to him, "Your language was unparliamentary.
It is not etiquette to assume that a lady cares
for you when you have not asked her to. You
have no right to resent her resenting such
unconventional behavior. You owe her an
apology: go and make it like a man, and withdraw
the offensive epithet, term, phrase, clause,
or sentence, which ever it might be." Then I
would say to her, "He meant no harm. How
do you expect a member from Wayback to be
posted on all the usages of metropolitan society?
You ought not to have come down on him so
hard. Let the man say he is sorry, and forgive
him. You were mainly to blame yourself;
but seeing it is you, we'll pass that." Then
I would stand over them like the heavy father
in the plays, and say, "You love each other.
Take her, Jim: take him, Clarice. Bless you,
my children." That is the way it ought to be
done, and that is the way I would fix it if it
concerned common every-day people like myself,
with no pretence to qualities higher than practicability
and common sense&mdash;supposing such
people could have got into such a mess, which
I own is improbable. A method that would
answer for them is not so easily applied to these
superfine specimens, who have taken such pains
to build themselves a private Purgatory, and
keep it going on a limited supply of fuel. They
might resent intrusion on their agreeable demesne,
and put up a board with 'No Trespassing'
on it; but then they ought to keep the
place fenced in better: as it is, the smoke and
heat spread too much. They might say, 'If we
enjoy our misery, what right have the rest of
you to interfere?' Yes, but what right have
they to rope in the rest of us, who are not so
addicted to the luxury of grief, and make us
miserable too? That's what it comes to.
'Each man's life is all men's lesson,' and each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
woman's too. Now if our high-toned friends
had kept this particular part of their lives in
manuscript, and not supplied us with copies,
but reserved it for spelling out in secret at their
own leisure, the case would be different. As
it stands, this embroglio is a lesson which I
have got by heart and am tired of: I would like
to set it aside and turn to something more
cheerful. Moreover, as the head of a family I
have duties in the matter, for it affects us all.
I don't mind so much about Jane: she thinks
this is a XX. romance, which the parties chiefly
concerned are conducting in the most approved
manner; if she had one of her own, I suppose
this would be her style&mdash;her idea of how the
thing should be done.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is not mine, however;
far from it. Shall I sit passive, and see
the clouds of care growing heavier about the
wife of my bosom, and the furrows deepening
in that once marble brow? She looks two years
older than she did two months ago, and she
owns it. I have three lovely children: how brief
a space it is since they played in the abandonment
of infant glee! And now their young
existence, too, is darkened. Herbert no longer
slides down the banisters, with his former recklessness,
but sits and looks wistfully at Cousin
Clarice. The change involves a saving in lint
and arnica, but a loss of muscular development.
You see, we are all of the sympathetic&mdash;which
is the expensive&mdash;temperament: we have not
sense enough to be content each with his or her
own personal affairs, and let the others arrange
their private funerals at their own charge.
There is more truth than I thought in part of
what I told Hartman, that night on the boat.</p>

<p>This thing must stop. I will have to ask
the Princess if she wants our humble abode to
be a house of mourning much longer. We
might accommodate her in that respect for</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
another month or two, but not permanently.
Lovers are so selfish: they don't care if they
upset all your domestic arrangements, and spoil
your harmonies with the discord of their sweet
bells jangled. It ought not to be encouraged,
nor yet allowed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>I was wholly mistaken in this, as will appear by the

<h3><a name="Conspiracy" id="Conspiracy"></a>XIX.</h3>

<h4>CONSPIRACY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> summer has not done for any of us what
it ought; quite the reverse. Even I am not in
my usual form, if Mabel and Jane are right.
They had let me alone for some time: last
night they attacked me together&mdash;a preconcerted
movement, obviously.</p>

<p>"Robert, you are pale, almost haggard. You
need a change."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "I've just had a change&mdash;or
rather several of them. We've been back only
three weeks."</p>

<p>"You need mountain air: the sea does not
agree with you. And Newport is not what it
used to be."</p>

<p>"It's a good deal more so, if you mean that;
but I don't know that its increased muchness
has damaged my health to any great extent."</p>

<p>"You prefer small, remote places, and their
way of life; you know you do. They are more
of a change from town. You bought the house
at Newport for our sakes. I have often feared
you were sacrificing yourself to us&mdash;with your
usual disinterestedness, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, my usual disinterestedness is ready to
be worked again, to any reasonable extent, if
you will say what you're after. But how can I
leave the business now?"</p>

<p>"O, the business!" (It was Jane this time.)
"That is all very fine, when you don't want
to leave town. But I notice that the business
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
never interferes with any of your junketings.
What are your clerks paid for? Can't they attend
to the business?"</p>

<p>"A fine idea you women have of business,
and a fine success you'd make of it. Jane,
suppose you take charge in Water Street while
I am away."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt I could do it quite as well as
you, after a little practice. Why, brother, Mr.
Pipeline understands it a great deal better
than you do. Our father, in his later years,
trusted him entirely."</p>

<p>"Yes, Robert," said Mabel, "and how often
you have assured me that Mr. Pipeline was
absolutely competent and reliable. When we
were married, and a hundred times since, you
explained your carelessness and indifference
about the business by saying that all was right
while old Mr. Pipeline was there: he knew
everything, and kept the whole force to their
work. It was that, you said, which enabled
you to be so much more about the house than
most men could be, and so attentive and satisfactory
as a husband and father."</p>

<p>She had me there: who would expect a
woman to remember things and bring them up
in this way, so long after? So I tried to turn
it off.</p>

<p>"O, well, he hasn't gone to Canada yet: the
books seem straight, and the returns are pretty
fair. But it is well for the head of the firm to
look in occasionally, all the same."</p>

<p>"You do look in occasionally, Robert: no one
can accuse you of neglecting that duty. Would
I have married a man who neglected duty, and
allowed his business to go to ruin, and his
family to come to want? Your conscience may
rest perfectly easy on that score, dear."</p>

<p>"O, thank you: it does. I've not often allowed
the state of the oil market to interfere
with sleep or appetite, or with my appreciation
of you and the children. Family duties first,
my dear; what so sacred, so primary, as the ties
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of Home? But such virtue is not always duly
prized there. I'm glad you do me justice."</p>

<p>"I always have, Robert; always. Whatever
Jane and others might say about your levity
and your untimely jests and so forth, I have
steadily maintained that you had a good heart."</p>

<p>"There, Jane, do you hear that? Mabel
knows, for she is in a position to know."</p>

<p>"Of course, brother, we are all aware of that.
If you had not that one redeeming trait, I
should have left you long ago, even if I had
had to get married. You admire Artemus
Ward: he had a giant mind, you recollect, but
not always about him. So with your good heart
at times. But we are wandering from the
point. Mabel, you were showing him how he
could go away for a week or two without neglecting
his important duties down town."</p>

<p>"Why yes, Robert. You have been here
three weeks now, and I am sure you have been
at the store nearly every day. Indeed, when
you <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'was'">were</ins> not at home, or at the club, or somewhere
about town, I doubt not you might be
found in Water Street a good part of the time."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said with an air of virtuous complacency,
"I believe you are right. I can't
deny it, though it may help your side of the
argument."</p>

<p>"Well then, you can surely be spared during
a brief absence. And when you return, you
can continue to look in occasionally, as you
say."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I could, though it is not well to
be too positive. Where do you think I ought
to go?"</p>

<p>"Well, you are fond of fishing and hunting.
You might go up and spend a week with Mr.
Hartman. You found good sport there, you
said."</p>

<p>"O yes, there are trout enough, and deer not
far off, he told me. But I was there in May.
And it is not very comfortable at Hodge's, if
you remember."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
"But of course this time you would stay
with Mr. Hartman. You refused his invitation
before, and it was hardly civil to such an old
friend."</p>

<p>"He has a mere bachelor box, my dear, and
I hardly like to thrust myself on him."</p>

<p>"Why, Robert, I am surprised at you. After
Mr. Hartman spent a fortnight with us at
Newport&mdash;and when he has written you twice,
urging you to come. Can't you see that the
poor man is lonely, and really wants you?"</p>

<p>"Mabel, it would be all very well if it were
like last May&mdash;only he and I to be considered.
But here is that blessed entanglement of his
with Clarice&mdash;quarrel, or love-making nipped
in the bud, or whatever it was&mdash;that complicates
matters. After all the lectures I've had
from you two, I don't want to complicate them
any more, nor to meddle in her affairs, nor
appear to. Suppose I go up there, and he
wants news of her, and anything goes wrong,
or it simply doesn't come right as you expect;
I'd have your reproaches to bear ever after, and
perhaps those of my own conscience. You're
not sending me off simply for my health, or for
a little fishing. If I go to Hartman, the sport
will not be the main item on the programme;
and that every one of us knows perfectly well.
So I don't move till I see my way straight."</p>

<p>Finding me thus unexpectedly firm, Jane
looked at Mabel, and Mabel looked at Jane, and
there was a pause. You see, in this last deliverance
I had uttered my real mind&mdash;or part
of it&mdash;and it naturally impressed them.</p>

<p>My sister's share in the discussion had thus
far been confined to the few efforts at sarcasm
duly credited to her above&mdash;let no one say that
I am unjust to Jane. She had been watching
me pretty closely, but I hardly think she saw
anything she was not meant to see. Now she
came to the front, looking very serious&mdash;as we
all did, in fact.</p>

<p>"Well, brother, some things are better understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
than spoken&mdash;from our point of view.
But if you insist on having all in plain words,
and playing, as you call it, with cards on the
table&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just so," said I. "You use your feminine
tools: I use mine, which are a man's. If I
have to do this piece of work, it must be on my
own conditions and after my own fashion, with
the least risk of misunderstanding."</p>

<p>"Robert, if this is affectation, you are a
better actor than I thought. But if you really
know no more than we do&mdash;"</p>

<p>This was too much for Mabel. "Now, Jane,
you go too far. Robert likes his little joke,
but he knows when to be serious. Why do you
suspect him so?"</p>

<p>Jane went on. "Of course it is possible he
may be no deeper in Clarice's confidence than
we: she is very reticent. You mean, brother,
that you will do nothing till she authorizes
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, this is her affair. For you,
or me, or anybody else, to meddle in it without
her direction, or permission&mdash;unless in case of
obvious extremity&mdash;would seem, by all rules
alike ethical and prudential, a delicate and
doubtful proceeding, to say the least."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right there. Mabel, you
may as well tell him. Robert, don't think,
from all this preamble, that it is of more importance
than it would otherwise seem. Perhaps
we might as well have told you at once;
but we are only women, you know. Now at
last we are using your tools&mdash;the tools you
always use with such manly consistency&mdash;candor
and open speech. Tell him, Mabel."</p>

<p>"Robert dear, Clarice told me to-day that
you were looking badly; she thought you
needed a change. 'Is he not going off for his
fall fishing?' she said."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"It is a good deal for her," said Jane. "If
you want more, ask her. Are you less concerned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for her happiness than we are? Must
we arrange all the preliminaries? Brother, if
<i>I</i> could do anything, no fear of consequences or
reproaches should tie my hands: I would do
what is right, and take the chances. If I stood
where you do, I would have this matter settled,
or know why it could not be. I would never
sit idle, and see two such lives spoiled&mdash;and all
our hearts broken. O, I know you love them
both. But you are so cautious&mdash;unnecessarily
and absurdly so at times, and wedded to useless
diplomacy, when only the plain speech you talk
about is needed. You stand in awe of Clarice
too much: you may wait too long. Forgive
me, Robert; but whatever she may say, you
<i>must</i> see Mr. Hartman before winter."</p>

<p>I could have embraced Jane, besides forgiving
her slurs on me, which may contain an
element of truth. There is more in her than I
have supposed; and of course what she insists
on is exactly what I have all along meant to
do. But it did not come in handy to say so at
this point. "I'll think it over. You two had
better go to bed: I must go out and smoke."</p>

<p>"Robert," said Mabel, "don't go out to-night.
You can smoke in the dining-room."</p>

<p>"No; I'll not take a base advantage of your
present amiable mood. But I tell you what it
is; if you want to get Hartman here in cold
weather you must let us have a snuggery. He
can't do without his tobacco."</p>

<p>It was a fine night, and I wanted a walk as
well as a smoke. I felt gratified, for this thing
had gone just as I desired. I am not quite so
impulsive as Jane, and I understand the difficulties
as she does not; but my plan has merely
waited for events to give it definite shape and
make it feasible. Certainly I must see Hartman,
and as he can't come here, I must go
there. But I wanted the women to suggest my
going; that divides the responsibility, and gives
them a hand in the game. I would have had
to propose it myself within a week or so, if they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had not spoken. But the Princess knows what
she is about, and what is fit and proper. It
may seem strange that she should speak to
Mabel instead of to me; but she will say what
she has to say to me before I start. In fact,
I'll not start till she does&mdash;how could I? It is
her business I am going on, with just enough of
my own to give it a color. I'll write to Jim at
once, to ask when he wants me: the mails are
slow up there, and it may be a week before his
answer comes. That will give me time to get
my instructions, and not be in any unseemly
haste to seek them either. So far, so good; but
there is more to be done, and delicate work too,
such as will bear no scamping. It is the biggest
contract you ever undertook, R. T., and
you must make a neat job of it.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Apology_for_Lying" id="Apology_for_Lying"></a>XX.</h3>

<h4>APOLOGY FOR LYING.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you do not understand my waiting for
Mabel and the girls to prompt this move, and
allowing them to urge it against my apparent
reluctance, I ascribe this failure on your part
to lack of experience, rather than to any deeper
deficiency. Some men like to make a parade
of independence, and to do&mdash;or pretend to do&mdash;everything
of themselves, without consulting or
considering their womankind. But such are
not the sort I choose my friends from; for I
have been accustomed to regard both brain and
heart as desirable appurtenances to a man.
There is little Bruteling, at the club, who would
like to be considered a man of the world&mdash;but
I can't waste space or time on him. And I
have met family men even&mdash;but I don't meet
them more than once if I can help it&mdash;who
regard their wives and sisters as playthings,
dolls, upper-class servants, not to be trusted,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
taken into their confidence, or treated with
any real respect. Such heresies have no place
under a Christian civilization, which has exalted
Woman to her true rank as the equal and
helpmeet of Man, the object of his tenderest
affections and most loyal services. It is in his
domestic life that one's true character is shown;
and Home is not only the dearest place on
earth to me and to every one whose head is
level, but the stage on which his talents and
qualities are best brought out.</p>

<p>You think that I don't practice what I
preach; that I introduce within those sacred
precincts too much of play-acting and small
diplomacy, as Jane says; that even at this
moment my thoughts and intentions in a matter
which concerns us all are imperfectly revealed
to my nearest and dearest? Ah, that is owing
to the difference between the sexes, and to the
singular lines on which the Sex was constructed,
mentally speaking. I don't wish to criticize
the Architect's plans, but it seems to me I
could suggest improvements which might have
simplified relations, and avoided much embarrassment.
The difficulty is that women, as a
rule, can neither use nor appreciate Frankness.
Just after I was married, I thought it was only
the fair thing to tell Mabel about several girls
I had been sweet on before I knew her. Would
you believe it, she burst into tears, and upbraided
me with my brutality; and she brings
up that ill-advised disclosure against me to this
day. I know several ladies who will not lie,
under ordinary circumstances&mdash;not for the mere
pleasure of it, at least; Clarice, for instance,
and Jane, I believe; but not one who will tell
the whole truth, or forgive you for telling it.
Well, well, we have to take them as they are,
and make the best of them: they have other
redeeming traits, as Jane says of me. In
heaven these inequalities will be done away,
and one can afford to speak out&mdash;at least I hope
so. But meantime you can see how these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
feminine peculiarities hamper a man, and check
his natural candor, and impose on him a wholly
new, or at least a hugely modified, ethical code.
If I were to follow my original bent, which
was uncommonly direct and guileless, I should
be in hot water all the time. It is this struggle
between nature and&mdash;well, I can hardly call it
grace; let us say necessity, or environment&mdash;which
is making me bald, and fat, and aging
me so fast. You have seen, in the course of
this narrative, what scrapes I have gotten into
by speaking before I stopped to think, and
blurting out the simple truth. I was once as
honest as they are ever made&mdash;and for practical
and domestic uses nearly an idiot. I have been
obliged, actually forced, to deny myself the indulgence
of a virtue, and diligently to cultivate
the opposite vice. The preachers don't know
everything: I could give them points. I don't
say I have succeeded remarkably, and the exercise
has been deeply painful to me; but it was
absolutely essential, if I was to be fit for the
family circle, and able to do or get any good
in this imperfect world. There is no escape,
unless you live in a hermitage like Hartman.
You may have noticed that my loved ones
sometimes appear to treat me with less than
absolute respect and confidence: it is the result
of this life-conflict, which has left me with a
character mixed, and in one respect wrecked.
But they would think much worse of me than
they do if I told them the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, on all occasions.
Thus I might&mdash;and then again I might
not&mdash;go to our poor Princess, and say, "Clarice,
Mabel and Jane think I ought to see Hartman.
I think so too, and they report you as concurring
in the verdict. This is delicately put
under cover of my health and the fall fishing;
but we all know that you and Jim want looking
after more than I do, and that bigger game
than trout is to be caught. Tell me what you
want me to say to him and do with him, and I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
will start at once." Some women might stand
that, possibly, but not the ones I am used to:
such would be eminently the way not to attain
my benevolent end. No, no; you can do nothing
in such cases without finesse, as Jim calls
it, and strategy, and tact, and management;
and if you have not these gifts by nature, you
must acquire them, whatever they may cost.
I still hold to my principles; but I don't propose
to run them into the ground. In morality, as
elsewhere, a little too much is apt to be worse
than much too little; and theory and practice
are very different things, not to be rashly
confounded. You want to hold the right
theories, and then to live as near them as depraved
mundane conditions will allow. The
manly weapons of which Jane spoke so scornfully
last night are the right ones&mdash;when you
can use them. In the case in hand, to tell all I
know would have been at any time, and would
still be, impossible and ruinous. Hartman is
not so far out on some points: as he says, we
did not arrange the present scheme of things,
and could not be proud of it if we had.</p>

<p>You may say, and I could not deny, that my
diplomacy, such as it is, is not always employed
for the benefit of women <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'only' with no period">only</ins>. Hartman is a luminous
and transparent soul&mdash;too much so for
his own good: why did I practise occasionally on
him? I can explain that best on general principles.</p>

<p>In a world a majority of whose inhabitants are
female, demoralization has naturally extended
far and wide, till strict veracity has become
unpractical. The first falsehood (after the serpent's)
must have been humiliating to him who
uttered it, and a fatal example to those who
heard; but mankind soon grew used to the new
fashion. I pass over the rude barbarian ages,
whose gross and inartistic lying offers no claim
to respectful and sympathetic interest, and no
excuse but the lame one of selfish depravity,
common to the race. But with the inroads of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
civilization Life became complex, and Truth
was found too simple and rigid to fit with all
its varied intricacies. That is, when Truth <i>is</i>
simple. "Don't you think my baby beautiful?"
demands a fond parent. "No, I don't: far
from it." That is the truth; but its naked
and repulsive brutality demands to be clothed
with the garb of humane and graceful
fiction. "Prisoner at the bar, are you guilty
or not guilty?" He is guilty, of course; but if
he says so, it is a dead give-away. In this case
indeed the interests of Truth are one with those
of Society, though not of the prisoner; but often
it is different. The basis of ethics, our moralists
say, is as largely utilitarian as it is ideal.
If so, is there any special sacredness about cold
facts, that they should get up on end and demand
to be published everywhere continually?
Truth ought to be modest, and not claim all
the observances and honors, seeing there are so
many other deities whom we poor mortals are
no less bound to worship. When Grotius' wife
lied to the policeman about her husband's
whereabouts, the lie was an act of piety, whereas
truthtelling would have been murderous
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'infielity'">infidelity</ins>. If the minions of the law were after
me, would I thank Mabel and Jane and Herbert
for telling them which way I had gone? There
is no more aggravated nuisance than he who
insists on exposing all he knows at all times
and places&mdash;as I used to do before I learned
these tricks. Look at poor Hartman, ejecting
his honest backwoods thought without asking
whether it was a wise and decent offering to
his small but highly select audience; and see
what trouble he has brought on himself and all
of us thereby.</p>

<p>This outspokenness is often mere self-indulgence.
Take me, for instance: to this day, in
spite of all the lessons I have had, it is far
easier and pleasanter for me to tell the truth
than not. People of this temperament must
learn to put a check on nature. Self-indulgence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
is bad, all agree, and self-denial useful
and necessary. This is the way virtues clash
and collide. I say, confound such a world.
What is a plain man to do in it? As the poet
sings, the <i>Summum Bonum</i> belongs in heaven,
and you can't expect to get at it here, but
must simply do the best you can, which is
generally not very good. And then, as another
poet puts it, very likely nobody will appreciate
your efforts, but you will get cuffed for them:
we are punished for our purest deeds, and so
forth.&mdash;But this is trenching on Hartman's
province. It is well that I should think all
this out now: I can talk it over with him
before we get to business. He will want sympathy
with his notions about the depravity of
things in general, and that will smooth the
way, and make him willing to open up on the
specific woe that lies nearest.</p>

<p>To return to our muttons. The guilt of
duplicity has lain heavy on my conscience for
two months, but how can I help it? I don't
so much mind keeping what I know from
Mabel and Jane, for it is not their affair. But
it is Clarice's affair&mdash;most eminently so&mdash;and I
had promised solemnly to tell her at once when
I knew or thought of anything that concerned
her. It was obviously impossible to keep my
promise in this case&mdash;not on my account, but
on hers. It will not be easy to tell even Jim
that I overheard their last colloquy, and witnessed
the tragical parting scene: I'll have to
watch my opportunities, and spring that on
him just at the right moment, when it will
have the best effect. Now any one who knows
Clarice must see that to tell her this would
be to take the most awful risks, and probably
to destroy all chance of reconciling them; that
is level to the meanest apprehension, I judge.
No sir: it can't be done till I have seen Jim,
and got things in train. Properly handled,
the secret&mdash;that is, my possession of it, which
is a second secret, almost as weighty as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
original one&mdash;may be a tool to manage both
these intractable subjects with, and bring them
to terms: in a fool's hands, and thrown about
promiscuously, it would be an infernal machine
to blow us up. No: I'll take whatever guilt
there is, rather than hurt Clarice now and
hereafter. Do you want to know my opinion
of a man who is always and only thinking
about keeping his hands clean and his conscience
at peace, so that he can't do a little
lying&mdash;or it might be other sinning&mdash;on adequate
occasion, to serve his friends or a good
cause? I think he is a cad, sir&mdash;a low-minded
cad; and of such is not the kingdom of heaven.
It may not occur every day: it might not do to
insert in the text-books as a rule; but once in a
while there may be better businesses than saving
one's soul and keeping one's conscience void
of offense.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>I am arguing against my own nature in all
this. In my heart I love Truth above all
things, and follow and serve her with a devotion
that is probably exaggerated. But I can't
help seeing that there are two kinds of her.
When she is simple and obvious, she seems to
reside in bare facts, which we may easily respect
too much, for what are they but blackguard
carnalities? Preraphaelitism in art,
Realism in literature, might be all very well
if they would keep their place&mdash;which is in
the kitchen. Some may want pots and pans,
and scullions, and pigs' feet, and ribs of beef
described. I don't myself; but it is a free
country, and vivid and accurate portraiture of
these delicacies may constitute the main charm
of literature for some readers, possibly. But
Realism wants to take its pots and pans into
the parlor: it always overdoes things. "A
daisy by the river's brim a yellow daisy was
to him, and it was nothing more." Well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
what else should it be?&mdash;But perhaps I have
not got that right. Pass on to our next head.</p>

<p>Truth is not always simple&mdash;by no means
always. Often she is highly complex, and as
much mixed as I was just now; and then you
don't know where she is, or what she is, and
it gets to be all guesswork. One says, Here,
and another says, There: the philosophers upset
each other's schemes in turn, the theologians
hurl reciprocal excommunications, the
scientists of to-day laugh at those of last year.
If Pilate meant it this way, we owe him some
sympathy and respect. "Speak the truth and
shame the devil," they say. Bah! [I think
this expletive ought to be spelt <i>Baa</i>.] When
you know what the truth is, you are more
likely to shame your friends, and become obnoxious
and ridiculous. And in most cases
you don't know, and if you suppose you do,
you are mistaken. I have thought out a way
of approximating Truth on a large scale, and
more nearly than most succeed in doing; but
this is a big topic, and I had better keep it to
entertain Hartman with.</p>

<p>O yes; I was to explain why I sometimes use
roundabout methods even with him. If you
tell all you know to everyone you meet, or disclose
your real character, it will generally be a
waste of good material which might better be
economized. By the way, what <i>is</i> my real
character? How should I know? One sees
one side of it, another another. I see all that
have turned up yet, but there may be many
more, thus far latent; and how am I to harmonize
them all, and take the average of a
succession of phenomena? I am complex, like
Truth.</p>

<p>But I must not interrupt myself any more.
Let us fall back on the utilitarian basis of
ethics. You see, if I had talked like this to
Jim when we met last May, he would have put
himself on guard and begun to study me,
whereas I wanted to draw him out&mdash;as I did.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
I have no objection to people studying me
when I don't care to study them; but when
there is anything to be done for them you have
got to understand them first, and to this end
it is best to appear simple and not distract their
minds from the contemplation and disclosure
of their own qualities: you can play on their
vanity if your own does not stand in the road.
Hartman has a fine mind, but in his innocent
rural way he took for granted that I had stood
still since we were together at college. So I
played to his lead, and pretended, for instance,
to know nothing about poetry; whereas, as you
must have noticed, I am pretty well read, and
my memory is remarkably copious and accurate.
(Clarice did indeed say that I sometimes got
the lines wrong; but what she meant was that
the passages I quoted in my well-meant efforts
to console her were of too gay a character for
her melancholy mood.)</p>

<p>In this way I secured Jim's regard and confidence,
which I am using for his good: if I
had put myself forward, and been anxious to
impress him with my importance, he might
have looked on me with the cynical indifference
which is all the feeling he can afford to most
people, and I should never have got him out of
the woods. So when I was taking him to
Newport, I said what it was desirable to say,
and omitted what was not: how else should a
rational man talk? And that first night there,
I took the tone that he required, as a host is
bound to do: sacred are the duties of christian
hospitality. Poor Jim is as good as a play; he
takes Life in such dead earnest, and expects
his friends to be rampant idealists too: so I
mounted the high horse for once to gratify him.
He will never forget that, nor cease to respect
me accordingly: he thinks I was serious then,
and joking at all other times. You and I of
course understand that Life is but a series of
appearances; and if I seem to contradict myself,
to say one thing on one page and its opposite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
on <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'the the'">the</ins> next, I am only reporting the
various phases assumed by facts without and
moods within. 'The shield is <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: the original has no period following 'gold'">gold</ins>.' 'No, it is
silver.' Well, shall we fight about that?
Probably it is both. A thing may be black in
one light, and white in another, for what I
know. Of all fools the positive philosophers
seem to me the worst; and the most abject
kind of conceit is that of alleged consistency.
Why will you insist on a definiteness which has
so little place in nature? The world is a
chameleon, and you and I are smaller copies
of it.</p>

<p>I must try to explain all this to Hartman, and
make him see that it is time he took on another
color. He has been down in the depths all this
while; now let him get up on the heights.
But he would never do it of himself, nor without
the management of a more practical mind.
If I took things as he does, I should be tempted
to say, "You monumental idiot, to fling a rash
word at a girl as proud as Lucifer, and then to
take her hasty repartee as a final verdict from
doomsday book!" Happily there is one person
around with sense enough to see that both
these moon-struck babes are forgivable, and
therefore capable of such bliss as may be found
in a world of which the best to be said is that
we are in very small measure responsible for it.
They were both foolish, of course; but what
proportion does their joint offence bear to their
punishment&mdash;and ours? That is the Order of
Things&mdash;this blessed and beautiful Kosmos.</p>

<h4>JANE TO THE RESCUE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may seem unfeeling in me to indulge in
dissertations like the above at so critical a
juncture: but they serve to fill the time while
I am waiting for marching orders. I have
written to Jim, and that is all I can do at
present. Jane thinks differently: she ought to
have been a man, she is so fond of action. She
got me in a corner to-day.</p>

<p>"Well, brother?"</p>

<p>"Well, Jane?"</p>

<p>"What have you done?"</p>

<p>"Done? what should I do?"</p>

<p>"Use a man's tools, that you are so fond of;
plain speech, if no more. Have you spoken
to Clarice yet?"</p>

<p>"No: why should I speak to her? She spoke
to Mabel, not to me."</p>

<p>"Robert, are you ever sincere in anything?
When <i>I</i> profess affection for people, I am ready
to serve them at their need."</p>

<p>"So am I, and Clarice knows it. She is perfectly
aware that I am ready to do this thing,
or any other thing within my power, for her at
any time. It is easy for her to say what she
wants."</p>

<p>"Brother, you are <i>so</i> stupid! Don't you
know that it is excessively difficult for her to
allude, however remotely, to a matter like this?
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: 'Say with a quotation mark">Say</ins> what she wants, she would die first. Do
you desire to wait for that? She is not like
the rest of us; and a woman is not like a man.
<i>You</i> could talk for a week, and turn your
whole mind inside out, with no fatigue&mdash;except
to your audience; but the faintest reference to
what I need not name would cost her a painful
effort. I told you it was a great thing for her
to say what she did to Mabel. That ought to
have been enough for you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"How could it be enough? Do try to talk
sense now, Jane. How can I go off blindly
on a fool's errand&mdash;in her interest, but without
commission or instructions?"</p>

<p>"Ask her for them, then. It is ungenerous
to put on her the burden of opening the subject.
She is doubtless waiting for you to speak,
and wondering at your slackness."</p>

<p>"Hanged if I can understand that. How
many times have you lectured me about showing
her proper respect, and restraining my native
coarseness, and what not; and now you want
me to go to her like a trooper or a grand inquisitor,
and ask about the state of her feelings
toward Hartman. I can't do it, Jane. When
you get into such a scrape, I might try it, if
you insisted&mdash;though it would go against me,
as Sir Lancelot said: then you could see how
you liked it. Clarice wouldn't like it at all;
and she has deserved better things of me than
that."</p>

<p>"She <i>has</i> deserved better things of you than
she is getting. I thought you loved her as I
do. So that was only one of your pretences?"</p>

<p>"I love her too well to harass her; to intrude
upon her solitude when she does not want me;
to pry into her affairs without her consent, and
destroy what chance there is that she may call
me when she is ready."</p>

<p>"She will never be ready, unless we, that are
her first friends, come to her aid against her
own pride and shyness. You think me intrusive&mdash;a
meddlesome old maid, prying into
what does not concern me: but, brother, she
and Mr. Hartman were made for one another.
They were deeply interested, both of them&mdash;I
could see it plainly: it would have been settled
in a few days more, if that wretched misunderstanding
had not occurred. <i>He</i> may get over
it; he is a man, though he did not seem to be
that kind. But she&mdash;she is of the deep, and
silent, and constant type: she will nurse this
hurt till it kills her. I love her, Robert; she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
has nobody but us. She never knew a thing
like this before; it is her first experience.
Other men to her were playthings, or bores;
she had no friend among them but you. You
cannot fancy how hard it is for her; harder far
than for a younger girl. She is so helpless, for
all her pride&mdash;her pride makes her more helpless
to speak or act. If I could only help her,
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here, to my amazement, my stately
sister broke down in a passion of tears and
sobs: I never knew her do such a thing before.
I patted, and petted, and soothed her, and did
all that a man of humanity and experience
does in such cases. I shall apply for the title,
Consoler of Feminine Woes, since the business
of the office comes to me. It will be Mabel
next, I suppose, and then this thing must stop,
unless we begin the round afresh. Clarice
may naturally want to be comforted once or
twice more; but I hope soon to remove all
further occasion for that. Jane and I have not
been like this since we were children.</p>

<p>"There, there. Sister dear, I would knock
any man down, and insult any woman, who said
of you what you just said of yourself. You are
not an old maid, and you might be a society
leader if you cared for it: plenty of women are
who have more years and less looks and manners
and brains than you. You are as far as possible
from a meddler: your fault is that you keep
too much to yourself. I am sure Clarice would
be touched and flattered by your interest in
her: I should, if you took a quarter as much
in me. Do you know, I never saw you look so
well, or do yourself such credit&mdash;till now&mdash;as
night before last. My heart said amen to every
word you uttered, even when you were girding
at me; for you thought I deserved it, and in
part I did. I will have no more secrets from
you&mdash;except such as I have no right to impart.
If you will, we shall be friends now, and work
together in this thing. You always seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
despise me, Jane; and it is tedious when the
affection is all on one side."</p>

<p>"Yes: you used to have enough of that with
Clarice."</p>

<p>She was feeling better now. As I may have
said on some previous occasion, a little judicious
management will do great things for a woman.
I must keep this up if I can, and make appropriate
responses to all her remarks. I have
been too hard on Jane in the past. After all,
the tie between brother and sister is a peculiar
one&mdash;few more so; and, except for the Princess,
who is such only by adoption, each of us is all
the other has got in that line. Perhaps I ought
to have thought of this earlier.</p>

<p>"Clarice appreciates my virtues better now,
as I hope you will. But I was going to tell
you: I am of one mind and heart with you
about this, dear. I have always meant to see
Hartman this fall, of course; but it was better
that the suggestion should come from Mabel,
you see."</p>

<p>"You do tangle things up so unnecessarily,
Robert. Mabel would have approved of anything
you proposed, as a matter of course."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I have no desire to be a
dictator in the house, like some men. You all
have interests and rights to be respected, and I
want you to have your say."</p>

<p>"We would have it more cheerfully if you
would take yours&mdash;out plainly, in a man's way,
you know. Have you written Mr. Hartman?"</p>

<p>"Certainly: that same night, and asked if
he wanted me next week. That was simple
enough. I'm not afraid of <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>"I can't see why you should be so afraid of
Clarice. You've known her all her life, and
she is only ten years younger than you. If
she were but seventeen, now, and a new acquaintance,
I might understand it. You <i>must</i>
have it out with her, Robert. If I adopt her
style, perhaps you will do as I wish. Remember,
we are to work together in this thing, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you are of one mind and heart with me about
it; so you must let me direct you. Mind,
now!"</p>

<p>I stared: it was an imitation, gentle and
subdued indeed, of the Princess as she was in
her days of glory&mdash;not so long ago, alas!&mdash;before
the rains descended and the winds blew and
the storm beat upon her house of life: the
tones were there, and a hint of the arch looks.
Where did Jane learn these tricks? And what
has come over her? A maiden, even of her
years, is hardly warmed to life by a few compliments
and caresses from her own mother's
son. Can Hartman have waked her up too?
She laughed in my face.</p>

<p>"If our plot succeeds, you may be thrown
on my society again; and as you are going to
be so affectionate, I must fill Clarice's place as
well as I can. Meantime, you had better let
me guide you; indeed you had."</p>

<p>"That may be; only don't drive me too hard,
please. I'm not what I once was: all these
emotions are too many for me. Where do you
propose to guide me to?"</p>

<p>"To Clarice. Will you come now?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely: a nice reception we should get.
This is not a case where two are better far than
one. And then it would be three presently,
which never answers&mdash;when she is one of them.
I would rather go alone, and much rather not
at all. Guide me somewhere else, sweet sister:
or you can go yourself, if you like. But I
don't see why she should stand on ceremony
with me."</p>

<p>"Not with you, but with her own heart&mdash;a
more recent acquaintance, and much more
formidable."</p>

<p>"But that is there all the same, whether I
go to her or she comes to me."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;can't you see? She dislikes to
take the initiative."</p>

<p>"So do I. According to you, she has taken
it already."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
"Yes, and once is enough. You are so slow,
Robert: you require so much teaching."</p>

<p>"I know. But don't despair: Hartman says
you have improved me a heap, between you.
You see, the cases are different. None of you
are the least afraid of me&mdash;I should be sorry if
you were. But I am afraid of you: you are
such superior beings. You know you are: you
look on my masculine dulness with contempt;
and so do I. It is my deep and loyal respect
for a woman&mdash;which you said I would never
learn. Jane, you hurt me then; you have hurt
me often. I would have been fonder of you&mdash;showed
it more, I mean; but affection, repulsed,
shrank into the shell of indifference. Be kind,
now, and I will do anything you say. You see,
I <i>am</i> getting on."</p>

<p>"I wish you would get on toward the business
in hand. A nice time Clarice must have
had with you. I can see now why she had to
keep so tight a rein on you, and to rule you by
fear. Will you speak to her, or will you not?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will, before I go. We can't
hear from Jim for several days yet. She will
probably come to me before that. If not, I'll
have to go to her. Jane, there are some things
that you don't understand, and I can't explain."</p>

<p>"Queer things they must be, then. I wonder
that a man should be such a coward."</p>

<p>"If you were a man, you wouldn't. I don't
care to display my courage at home, sister.
You are harder than Clarice. You want me
to be all around the circle at once, and whatever
I do, you find fault. My dear, ever since
you spoke, I have been hanging about, to give
her a chance to say what she wants. How can
I stride up to her and shout, 'Here, tell me what
to say to your runaway lover'? She knows all
about it, if you don't. I'll wait to-morrow
after breakfast; tell her so, if you will. She
has only to look at me, and I'll ask her, if she
wishes. Then you can scold me to your heart's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
content for making a mess of it, and being
rough and brutal and stupid. Jane, I am
doing the best I can. If I could put myself
absolutely into your hands, and be but a voice
and body to your mind, it might be an improvement;
but unhappily that is not feasible
at present. Will what I propose answer?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps: I will see. I may have been unjust
to you, Robert: you are different from
most men, and not easy to understand: you
like to let part of you pass for the whole.
Whether you are so easy to rule as you pretend
to be, I am not sure yet. Well, there is time
to find out. If you live by your professions,
well and good. Kiss me, dear; good-night."</p>

<p>Since Jane has panned out in this unexpected
way, I wish I could tell her the Secret:
she might give me some points. But that is
impossible&mdash;unthinkable, as they say at Concord.
Clarice would never forgive me: that
would be bad, but not the worst. It would be
disloyal to her&mdash;distinctly so. That I've never
been yet, and I'm too old to begin now. There
may be cases in which the end justifies the
means, but this is not one of them. No: I
must dree this weird (if that is the expression),
and hoe this row, all by myself. If I had been
bred in the east, I should be tempted to say it
was a contumelious responsibility. The next
time you want to get into difficulties with a
lady, James Hartman, you must do it on some
other premises than mine.</p>

<h3><a name="An_Ordeal" id="An_Ordeal"></a>XXII.</h3>

<h4>AN ORDEAL.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning I was nosing about in the
library, pretending to be looking for a book,
when Clarice came to me and said, "I don't
think what you want is here. Leave business
this afternoon, and take me to the Park."</p>

<p>If she were to say, "Leave business this year,
and take me to Europe, or to Madagascar," I
should do it: she would have to arrange the
matter with Mabel, but that she could do without
difficulty, I have not the least doubt. It
would be a loss to Water Street, and my departure
would be felt in business circles generally;
but they would have to stand it as they
might. In this case, however, no heavy sacrifice
was involved: for a few hours, or days, or
weeks, Pipeline, as Mabel says, can conduct
the old stand well enough. What it needs is
the feeling that a master mind presides over its
destinies, though from such a distance as Newport
or the Wayback woods.</p>

<p>We agreed on an hour&mdash;that is, she told me
to be at the door at two&mdash;and I went down
town, feeling relieved. It is much better for
Clarice to take the responsibility of opening
communications, and I wish she would conduct
the whole interview, like a major-general with
his aid-de-camp or a master plumber sending
out his apprentices to mend the pipes&mdash;leaving
me only to take notes of instructions. But
that is too much to expect. It is a delicate
task before me, and my talents for such (according
to the ladies), are not so eminent that I
should be anxious to overwork them. I can
manage a man, and some women perhaps; but
to catechize and cross-examine her on a subject
as to which pride, and honor, and modesty lock
a girl's lips&mdash;I don't see how I can do it, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
with her consent. I would rather smoke my
pipe through a powder mill than hurt you, my
poor Princess: my clumsy fingers were never
made to play about your heartstrings.</p>

<p>I dropped in at Trinity on my way, and put
up a prayer; it was that she might make it easy
for herself, and for me, though that is a minor
matter&mdash;keep the game in her own hands, and
tell enough to serve her ambassador's need,
without his questioning.</p>

<p>She did not keep me waiting: she never had
that vice. The change in her is not for casual
eyes to see. Outwardly, I have fallen off more
than she has; in fact, I have lost three pounds
in these last two months. Many a hat was
raised, many an envious glance turned toward
me, as we spun up the avenue. The fellows at
the club, and elsewhere, used to pester me to
introduce them, and I gratified them for a
while, till she told me she could not have all
my acquaintances coming to call, and made
Mabel say I must leave off bringing men home
to dinner. She never was a coquette; but what
is a girl so endowed to do? They would force
themselves on her, by dozens, by scores, by hundreds:
they overflowed the house and took up
all her time; they crowded her life, until she
could stand it no longer and stopped it. That
is why we live so quietly of late: it is a great
improvement. Now, they gaze on her from
afar: yet she never had difficulty with any of
them&mdash;till August, alas. That was my fault,
for bringing in a wild man from the woods,
who could not be counted on or ruled like the
rest, but would flop around in his uncircumcised
way and break things. I should never forgive
myself for that, if I did not hope to get matters
right&mdash;and more so than they ever were, for her.</p>

<p>For a time we drove on silently. Then of a
sudden, without looking at me, she said very
quietly, "Jane told me you wanted to see me,
Robert."</p>

<p>O Lord, is this to be the shape of it after all?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Well, what must be must, and I will do my
stint as a man may. "Did she say nothing
else?"</p>

<p>"That you were afraid to come to me. Have
I been so harsh with you, or so terrible of late?"
Her tone was half arch, half reproachful.</p>

<p>"No, no; far from it. But you know how it
is, Clarice. Your trouble is ours, and I am a
poor surgeon. How can I put a knife into the
wound? I wish it were mine, and mine only."</p>

<p>"I have brought trouble on you all, brother.
I ought to have gone away."</p>

<p>"Never; do you think Mabel and Jane would
allow that, any more than I? We would all
rather break our hearts together, if that need
be, than have you among strangers now: it
would be worse for us, no less than for you.
When you are happy you may leave us; not till
then."</p>

<p>"I know. You love me, here, and bear with
me, and for me&mdash;though I don't deserve it."</p>

<p>"Don't say that&mdash;anything but that. My
Princess deserves everything&mdash;and by Jove, she
shall have it. If I knew exactly what she
wanted, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>All this time we had to be smiling and bowing
right and left. You can't make pretty
speeches under such circumstances, or do delicate
work. I had turned from the main drive,
but it was only a little better.</p>

<p>"Let us get out of this, Robert. There are
too many people: we can't talk here."</p>

<p>We went by streets which you must know, if
you are accustomed to have this kind of business
on hand. I trust you are not: a little of
it goes a long way. At last we got into a
quieter, semi-rural region. Find it out for
yourself, if you can: I am not going to tell you
the exact spots made sacred by these confidences.
Meantime I had been thinking what
to say, and it came out with a rush. It is a
little easier when you put the third person for
the second&mdash;yes, that is a good idea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
"If I were sure just what she wanted, she
should have that thing, if there is any power in
the human will. But I am clumsy, and thick-headed,
and make blunders&mdash;you have often
said so, Clarice, and so has Jane, and even
Mabel. She I speak of is of finer clay than
others. Her nature has its own laws, which I
can understand only very imperfectly. Yes,
you know it is so: you have told me that too.
O, she need not mind me, nor consider me in
the least. I am afraid only of offending or
hurting her: I only want to help and serve her,
if I can. If she could look on me just as a tool
to be used, an instrument in case she desired
to produce certain sounds&mdash;I wish I were more
capable of harmony&mdash;as a medium
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'possibly&mdash;But'">possibly&mdash;. But</ins>
she will not <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'speak perhaps'">speak&mdash;perhaps</ins> she cannot.
And how can I question her, as if from vulgar
curiosity? What right have I?"</p>

<p>Her eyes were wet now, under her veil: I
could see it, though nobody else could; and
we were on a country road.</p>

<p>"Robert, you are the best and dearest man
in the world."</p>

<p>"Hardly that. But I am proud of your
approval, and will try to earn it. I have not
earned it yet, you know."</p>

<p>"Brother, you rate me too high, and&mdash;and
her you speak of. What if she had what she
wanted within reach, and rudely thrust it
away?"</p>

<p>"But she did not do that, dear: she could
not. I am sure it is there yet, if she would
deign to take it."</p>

<p>"If that were certain, she would have others
than herself to think of. So long as it was or
might be merely herself, what could she do?"</p>

<p>I began to see light now. "There <i>are</i> others;
and though they are of less consequence, her
generous heart would not let them suffer.
Suppose to one of them this meant life or
death, hope or despair, use or uselessness.
Suppose one not like most of us, but simple,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sincere, and noble, unversed in the world's ways
and little loving them, with a great heart early
clouded and a strong mind warped thereby,
had begun to pin his faith to her I speak of,
and in her eyes to see reconciliation to earth
and heaven; and then for one rash word, one
casual misconception such as comes between
any of us, had fancied the cup of promise
snatched away, and in his misjudging innocence
gone back to his cave of gloom, thinking
himself doomed to a state worse than that from
which he had been nearly rescued. Would
she let him stay there forever?"</p>

<p>"I suppose she ought not&mdash;if she could help
it. It is well he has better friends than she
has proved. But I cannot talk of this: indeed
I cannot. It may be weak and foolish, but I
cannot. You must do what you have to do in
your own way.&mdash;No, I will not be such a
coward, and so basely ungrateful. O, I understand
your position, Robert. You will have to
question me: I am sorry, but it is the only
way. Ask what you absolutely need to know
for your own guidance&mdash;I know you will ask
no more&mdash;and I will try to answer."</p>

<p>I groaned; and then I could have choked
myself. Must my despicable selfishness add to
her burdens? What are my feelings, my petty
reluctance, to her interests? Have I not set
myself aside? Are you not man enough, Robert
T., to put a few civil queries to a lady,
when she has just given you express permission,
and even directed you to do so? The less you
sneer at cads after this, the better.&mdash;I was so
long making up my mind to it that the poor
girl had to speak again.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, brother. It is too bad to
burden you so. If I could save you the trouble,
I would, indeed. O, I appreciate your motives,
and your delicacy, and all your efforts to shield
and spare me&mdash;never fancy that I did not, I
have made more trouble than I am worth. If
I could only die, and end it all!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
This, as you may imagine, put a speedy end
to my shilly-shallying. "That would end it
all, with a vengeance. Some other people of
my acquaintance would want to die then too&mdash;or
before. Dearest Clarice, don't talk so. Two
things I can't bear&mdash;your lowering yourself like
this, and your exalting me. I am a hound: if
I were half a man, I'd have made it easier for
you. It is only that I distrust my own ability,
my own penetration, my own judgment. I
ought not to need any more instructions&mdash;but
this business is so important, and I'm afraid of
making a mess of it."</p>

<p>"Dear Robert, you lay too much stress on
the opinion I pretended to have of you, in days
when I only half knew you and thought far too
much of myself and too little of others. I
know better now. You have the insight of
sympathy: your heart will help your head.
You will not need to ask me many questions;
you can read between the lines."</p>

<p>"I will try. You need not answer in words
when you don't want to: just move your head
a little, and let me see your eyes. You see, in
view of my stupidity, the less risks we take
the better: I must have some things down in
black and white. Well then: you said something
to Mabel about my health, and the fall
fishing?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You do need a change; I have had
you on my conscience all this while. It is all
my doing; and you love me so." Her hand
stole into mine.</p>

<p>"That is certainly so. Do you know where
I would go if left to myself&mdash;if these last months
were blotted from the calendar?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Is it necessary to go through
all these formalities?"</p>

<p>"I think so: forgive me, dear. I must not
trust my intuitions too far: they are not as fine
as yours.&mdash;You know what construction might
be put on my going there now?&mdash;Not by the
outside world; it has nothing to do with this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
business, happily. But by any of us; and more
especially by&mdash;ah&mdash;by him?"</p>

<p>Her face was set now, her lips closed tight;
but she nodded.</p>

<p>"You have no word to send, I suppose?&mdash;No,
of course not: how could you? Then if
he asks, or if it is necessary to tell him about
you, as of course it will be, I am to say merely
what I think, so that you are nowise
responsible?&mdash;Yes,
I see. But the main thing to do
there is to make observations, and bring my
report to you?&mdash;Certainly: he must put himself
on record before you do, if this is to go on.
<i>If?</i> Of course it will: it shall be all right, my
dear child. Then it follows that I can't bring
him back with me?&mdash;Why no: he must bide
his time, and fulfil his penance. That is all, I
believe: the examination&mdash;or the operation, I
had nearly said&mdash;is over, and you have borne it
well. Thank you, Princess; and forgive me
for troubling you. You won't hate me, will
you, for having to be so horrid, and making
you go through all this?&mdash;Thank you again.
Shall we turn homeward now?&mdash;Yes, we'll be
there by dark."</p>

<p>She sat very still, and paler than I like to see
her. As for me, great beads of perspiration
were on my forehead, though it was a cool day.
I drove as fast now as the law allows. At last
she spoke, and her voice trembled. "Brother,
how shockingly we have all misjudged you!"</p>

<p>"No, dear: you did not misjudge me at all.
But you have been educating me, and it is fit
the best there is in me should come to the
front for your service&mdash;if it never put its head
up before, nor should again. Wait till I come
back: I've done nothing yet."</p>

<p>"You have done everything. The rest will
be easy for you, compared with this."</p>

<p>"By Jove, you are right there: I'm glad
we're through this part of it.&mdash;One thing more;
about Jane. She loves you as I do; she has
been berating me for indifference and slackness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in the cause. O, she is a trump: she was
crying bitterly last night because she could do
nothing to help you, and because I was too lazy
and cowardly to move; she has egged me on to
this. May I tell her what we have agreed on?"</p>

<p>"O yes, tell her anything you like, and Mabel
too. I have made you all such a poor return:
any other woman in my place would have
trusted you long ago, and been the better for
it. But I am so strangely made, Robert: my
lips are like a seal to my heart. Excuse me at
dinner, won't you? And promise me one
thing&mdash;that always, after this, you will come
to me at once, without scruple, when you want
me, on my account or on your own. As if I
could be reluctant to talk with you! Tell me
when you hear from him, and when you are
going, and&mdash;anything else. You won't mind
my silence, or wait for me to speak? And you
must never be afraid of me again."</p>

<h3><a name="Plan_of_Campaign" id="Plan_of_Campaign"></a>XXIII.</h3>

<h4>PLAN OF CAMPAIGN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess was seen no more that night,
and I got away till dinner time. Then I said
that she was not coming down, and anxious
looks were exchanged, and dark ones cast on
me. In return I winked at Jane, and frowned
severely on Herbert, who intercepted the signal
and began to grin. Mabel, who had seen it
too, reproved me for setting the boy a bad
example; and thus a diversion was effected.
While she was seeing after the children, my
sister carried me off to the library: I made her
kiss me before I would tell her anything.</p>

<p>"Jane, you may scold me as much as you
like after this, and I will never say a cross
word to you again. Hartman was right: he
said you had more penetration than any of us,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and all sorts of virtues. O, you needn't mind
about blushing; we are alone. It's true, and
I shall hold you in honor accordingly."</p>

<p>"Brother, I hope you have not spoiled your
work with careless handling. I always distrust
you when you begin your fine speeches."</p>

<p>"That was in the past, which we have put
behind us: they come now from the <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'abnndance'">abundance</ins>
of the heart. We are one, you know, and I
am to tell you everything. Jane, I've done
exactly as you told me, and given you all
credit. She knows it was your move; and it's
all right."</p>

<p>"Then you found that your imagination had
created, or greatly magnified, the difficulties,
and that your fears were unnecessary?"</p>

<p>"Far from it. It was a terrible job for both
of us: the mere recollection of it is harrowing.
Clarice is laid up, and only my superior physical
strength and fortitude, with an hour's recuperation,
enabled me to face you all at
table."</p>

<p>"Then you must have been rough with her.
Brother, how could you?"</p>

<p>"What did I tell you? You drive me, with
all your sharp-pointed feminine weapons, to a
painful task, and then you blame me because
you fancy I've not discharged it as neatly as
the angel Gabriel might. She thinks I did,
however. Was I rough with you last night?
Is it my habit to go around trampling on the
finer feelings of our nature? In the hour of
woe, when your heartstrings are torn asunder,
you will find me a first-class comforter. I
thought you knew that already."</p>

<p>"I doubt if Clarice knows it, if you took this
tone with her. Can you never be serious,
Robert?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Jane, what would you have?
Have I not been serious through two weary
months, and eminently so all this afternoon?
I had to be. Let the overstrung bow be relaxed
a little now. You remember the Prime Minister,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
who after an exciting debate used to go
home and play with his children?</p>

<p>"As exciting debates are usually conducted
in the small hours, it was cruel to disturb
their infant slumbers. If you want to do that
here you will have to get Mabel's consent; it is
out of my province. Best play with your children
before they go to bed."</p>

<p>"Children of a larger growth will serve.
Bear with me, sister. My faculties have been
sorely tasked: I am spent and weary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you must have somebody to play with.
Was that why you were so fond of Clarice, because
she sometimes humored you? She could
hardly serve your turn now: the poor child is
in no jesting mood. Nor am I; nor ought you
to be."</p>

<p>"Sister, you wrong me. It is my warmth of
heart, my fraternal affection, which you have
so oft-repulsed. Mine is a poet's nature. You
stare, but it is so: it is only lately that I
discovered the fact myself. Like the elder
Bulwer, I pine for appreciation, for sympathy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will continue to pine if you go on like
this. I never saw such a man for beating
about the bush and talking nonsense. What
have you accomplished?&mdash;I don't want to pry
into her secrets, or ask her to share her confidences,
but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Jane, if you have any heart left, I
will bring the tear of contrition to your eye.
I asked and obtained her permission to tell you
all I know, and all we have just arranged."</p>

<p>"Don't be so long about it, then. What
are the arrangements?"</p>

<p>So I imparted them with but little modification
or reservation; and Mabel coming in
presently, I went over the main outlines again.
It is not every man who could thus communicate
state secrets to his family; but mine never
talk about home affairs to outsiders. One
point is, they do not attend the Sewing Society:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
if they did, I should feel less safe. They approved
in the main.</p>

<p>"It hardly seems fair to Mr. Hartman," said
Jane; "but no doubt <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: it">it's</ins> as much as you can
expect from her."</p>

<p>"I should say it was: why, she is acting
nobly. If it were any other man, he should,
and would, have all the making up to do,
instead of putting it on us. You see, you&mdash;that
is, we&mdash;don't exactly know what the
quarrel was. He must have been in the wrong,
of course."</p>

<p>"O yes, because you are a man. Now suppose
I, being a woman, say, 'She must have
been in the wrong, of course.'"</p>

<p>"My dears," said Mabel, "let us compromise.
They are both human beings; probably they
were both in the wrong."</p>

<p>"Happy thought," said I. "We'll fix it that
way: then they have only to kiss and be friends.
But still, the man is generally expected to open
the ball."</p>

<p>"That is," said Jane, "if all does not go
smoothly from the start, which can hardly be
expected, poor Mr. Hartman is to be sacrificed."</p>

<p>"I would not put it just that way; though
he, or any man, ought to be glad to be sacrificed
for Clarice. She is naturally first with
me, as I should suppose she would be with
you&mdash;except that, as you pertinently observe,
you also are a woman. But never fear, Jane;
I'll attend to Hartman's case too. I hope to
act as attorney for both plaintiff and
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'defendent'">defendant</ins>,
and speedily to reconcile their conflicting
interests. It is true I am on a prospecting
tour: I have no retainer from him yet. But I
shall soon pocket that, and master his side of
the suit. O, I'll take him up tenderly, and
handle with care."</p>

<p>"Of course you will, Robert," said Mabel.
"If there is any quality for which you are distinguished,
it is the even-tempered justice of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
your mind. You can argue on both sides of a
case with equal fluency and force, and that quite
independent of your personal predilections."</p>

<p>"Just so. But I fear Jane has not the
same confidence in my fairness and ability
with you, my dear. You will have to talk to
her privately, and bring her to a proper frame
of mind. She is my only and much loved
sister, and I can't go till she has faith in me."</p>

<p>"It is you who are not in a proper frame of
mind as to Mr. Hartman's side of this affair,
brother. A man has no sympathy, no charity,
for another man. You can be all tenderness,
and consideration, and faith, and loyalty, to a
woman&mdash;when she has Clarice's looks; but
when it is only an old friend who trusts you,
you will laugh, and sneer, and amuse yourself
at his expense, and either delude him or hopelessly
estrange him."</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear the like? Yesterday,
and the day before, she insisted on my going;
and now, when I am all on fire to go, she
throws cold water on my zeal, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here my wife interrupted me. "Jane, it is
you who show undue levity. You forget that
Clarice is my cousin; that is why Robert is so
fond of her, and espouses her cause so warmly.
I think it is very good of him, and very generous."</p>

<p>"Now you have hit it: Jane, hide your diminished
head. Mabel, if Hartman can prove
affinity with you, I will take just as much
pains for him as for Clarice. But, sister, you
and I must be one. I tell you what I will
do: I will stay at home all next Sunday, and
let you preach to me: then, if you can't fill me
to the nozzle with your views, whose fault will
it be? Or you might go along, as you wanted
to in May. Then you could personally superintend
the campaign."</p>

<p>"My only hope is that you will sober down
before you get there. In this mood you could
do no good at all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
"That's where you are mistaken. Jim expects
me to brighten him up: <i>he</i> is not wholly
without a sense of humor. But if you think I
am going there for amusement, you are out
again. I shall take Young's Night Thoughts,
and Hervey's Meditations among the Tombs,
and a volume or two of sermons, to read on the
way, and get my mind attuned to the atmosphere
of the place. My jokes there will be
solemn and elaborate offerings, prompted solely
by a humane sense of necessity. But, Jane,
you are in a minority of one. Clarice has
confidence in me: you ask her. And so has
Mabel: haven't you, my love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. Why, Jane, Robert is the
only person who can possibly manage this
affair, since you and I can't well go, and
Clarice does not like to speak out herself. We
could not commit it to a stranger, you know.
Robert knew Mr. Hartman before any of us
did; they were old friends at college. He is
the natural link between them, you might say.
If he will only remember not to laugh in the
wrong places, as he did that time we took him
to church, when the minister thumped his
sermon off the pulpit, and not to tell the wrong
stories, as he so often does at table, and not to
yawn when Mr. Hartman explains how badly
he has been feeling since he left us, he will do
very well. You can't expect him to take the
same interest in Mr. Hartman as in Clarice:
would he care for us as he does, if we were
men? Jane, he is pointed out by Providence
as the means of reconciling them. You must
see that he is to be trusted entirely. Under
his supervision it will all come right: I said so
from the beginning."</p>

<p>After this, there seemed no need of further
remarks. Mabel withdrew early, and I went
out to smoke. When I came back, I found
Jane again in tears.</p>

<p>"Brother, tell me that you were only playing
with me, and that you are really in earnest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
about this matter, and will do your best to set
it straight."</p>

<p>"My dear sister, I will tell you anything you
like, if you will only believe me; what is the
use, if you won't? Do you suppose I care less
for Clarice's happiness than you do&mdash;or for
Jim's either? I wish you would talk to her,
and let her clarify your ideas. Faith, as you
may have heard in church, is a saving grace,
and essential to peace of mind. Within a
month or two you will see whether I fail my
friends or not, and then perhaps you will learn
to trust me. Jane, I believe in you now, even
if you don't believe in me; I would do almost
anything to please you. You want me to
change my nature: I would do even that, but
it is so expensive, and then the new one
might not fit as well as what I have now. You
are very exacting, but you can't quarrel with
me, because I will be no party to such proceedings."</p>

<p>"Brother, it all rests with you. If you will
bring them together, I will never doubt you
again."</p>

<p>"No, my dear, I'll not hold you to that.
You shall doubt me as often as you like; but
I will keep my promises all the same."</p>

<p>You see, I am trying new tactics with Jane
now. Magnanimity, patient forgiveness of injuries,
disinterested and persistent affection,
will in time soften the most obdurate. After
Clarice goes off, there will be so few of us left
that I can't afford to be on any but the best
terms with such as remain. And then my
sister, when she is willing to do herself&mdash;and
me&mdash;justice, has some quite creditable traits.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="To_Wayback_again" id="To_Wayback_again"></a>XXIV.</h3>

<h4>TO WAYBACK AGAIN.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I pass</span> succeeding interviews, of which there
were several. Poor Clarice had little to say,
but was quite willing to listen to any suggestions
of mine. What Jane unkindly calls
beating about the bush is necessary with a
person of her sensitive organization. She
seems to feel that she has fallen from her old
estate, and is not yet established in a new one.
I am satisfied that she never would have made
those admissions, slight as they are, and allowed
me to go on this secret embassy, if she
had only herself to consider. For the first
time duty to others has come into collision
with her pride, and shaken the citadel of her
reserve. Always hitherto she has had things
and people come to her; the exercise has been
in keeping them off. To want, to seek, to
invite&mdash;to lift a finger, unless in the way of
small and graceful social management&mdash;this is
new to her, and she takes it hard. The thing I
have to do beyond all others is to preserve her
dignity: she knows I can be trusted for that,
though Jane does not. I can't blame <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: punctuation on the original is unclear here">Jane:</ins>
she has never seen me conduct an affair like
this, nor has any one else, for the simple
reason that I never had it to do till now. I
am only her brother: she has had experience of
all my failings, and is imperfectly acquainted
with my resources. Mabel is more satisfactory.
She has not figured as much as some others in
this chronicle; connubial modesty prevents my
making her prominent. But she too possesses
some very good traits; especially she has a way
of bringing forward and dwelling upon points
which nobody else would think of mentioning.
She used to scold me sometimes, but that was
chiefly when she thought I was not treating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Clarice well. She lays great stress on ties of
blood, and considers herself natural guardian
and defender to the Princess, whom she sometimes
forgets that I knew for fifteen years
before I ever met her. Clarice talks little
with her, and no more with Jane: I really
believe that her only confidences&mdash;which are
not much, if measured by words&mdash;have been
made to me. But they are very fond of each
other all the same. I suppose you can understand
that much affection can exist with little
intimacy. The Princess was cast in her own
peculiar mould: I don't want to see many more
like her, for they would be poor imitations.
None of us ever attempt to pry into her inner
life&mdash;or to meddle with her outward life either;
when she wants anything of any of us, we are
ready, and there it ends. She knows we love
her, and that is enough.</p>

<p>Hartman, now, is much less impenetrable;
though I suppose he will shut himself up like
an oyster over the dubious pearl of his precious
secret, and give me no end of trouble to extract
his contents. But I possess a knife which is
able to open his shell. He has answered my
letter promptly, and expects me presently.
Does he think I am going up there merely to
fish and hunt, and hear him talk a lot of rubbish
about the Vanity of Life? Or does he
scent my deeper motives&mdash;discern the Ethiopian
within the encompassing pale, as they say in
Boston? If so, he is apparently as willing to
be operated on as he was before. At any rate
he is a gentleman, and knows how to respect a
woman&mdash;when he takes time to think about it.
This is a delicate business for him as well as
for the lady&mdash;and there is where the awkwardness
comes in: from his point of view he can't
speak out, any more than she. Well, I'll turn
him inside out and manipulate him, if it takes
the whole week. Happily I don't have to
consider him as I did Clarice; as Jane intimates,
a man can't expect to have his feelings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
spared in the process. What are a man's feelings
anyway, compared with a woman's? And
what rights has he as against <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'her'">hers</ins>? No: between
man and man all that can be needed is
plain speech and manly frankness&mdash;aided by
a little diplomacy. I'll break you to pieces,
James H., if you are fractious; and I've got
the weapons to do it with. It is all for your
good, and you'll bless me the rest of your life.
One thing must be understood: I can't have
you coming to my place and practising your
wild backwoods manners on my family, and
then sneaking off in the night and evading
responsibility. The next time you come you
will have to behave yourself, and to stay till
Somebody has had enough of you.</p>

<p>Mabel thinks I ought to enliven the account
of my trip with descriptions of scenery and the
like. But a rock is a rock, and a field is a
field, and who wants to know whether a tree is
elm or maple? I am not a geological survey,
and you can get mountains enough from Craddock.
Not that I am insensible to the beauties
of Nature&mdash;as I have proved before now. How
often have I sat upon an eminence, and admiringly
gazed at the departing luminary as
he sank slowly to rest, flooding hill and valley
with tints which a painter might strive in vain
to reproduce! I would have to sit there some
time to see it all, for I have noticed that with
us the Sunset proper does not begin till after
the Setting of the Sun is finished. And when
the distant mountains assumed a robe of royal
purple, and 'the death-smile of the dying day'
lingered pathetically on the horizon, my
thoughts would soar to the Celestial City, and
long to rest themselves upon its pavement of
liquid gold. I heard Dr. Chapin say these
last words at the first lecture I ever attended,
and it struck my infant intelligence
that they ought to be preserved. And I too
might be a poet if I lived in the country, in
constant communion with Nature, abandoning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
my soul to her maternal caress. But alas, the
stir, the scramble, the mad whirl of city life,
the debasing contact with low material minds,
the daily study of Prices Current, make even of
me a muckworm. Still, I might work up a
brook or two after I get to the woods, or expatiate
on a seven-pound trout: my conscience
forbids me to weigh them higher, for I never
saw any above three. And yet some men will talk
familiarly of ten-pounders!&mdash;Or I might analyze
the mediæval garments of Hodge and his old
Poll. As for the Wayback houses, they are like
any other habitations, only less of them, and
few and far between: Jim's is the best, and it is
nothing to brag of. You can see much better
buildings any day on Broadway. The rural parts,
as Lord Bacon observed, are but a den of savage
men. It is to see one of these, and resume the
interrupted process of civilizing him, that I am
about starting on this philanthropic journey,
leaving my happy home and the advantages of a
metropolis. If the savage breast is open to
ennobling influences, it shall be soothed and
charmed by the music of my discourse. What
loftier, more disinterested task than to reclaim
the wanderer, and guide the penitent in the way
wherein he should go? I began this soul-raising
labor some time ago, but an unexpected
hitch occurred in the proceeding: there must
be no more such now.</p>

<p>I found Hodge awaiting me at the station:
he said that Hartman was arranging the tackle
for to-morrow. The fact is, it is one of Jim's
notions not to keep a horse, but to depend on
Hodge for his communications with the outside
world; and another never to see the railroad
when he can help it.</p>

<p>"Well, old man," I said as the effete steed
began laboriously to get in motion, "how is
your valuable health?"</p>

<p>"Pooty tollable. How's them gells o' yourn
as wanted to foller ye up here las' time?"</p>

<p>"The ladies are reasonably well, and will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
flattered by your inquiries. How is Mr. Hartman?"</p>

<p>"Wall, Square, I ain't none too satyfied 'bout
him. He don't say nothin to nobody, but he
seems kinder low in his mind, like. Ever
sence you played that durn trick on me and
him, he's ben someways diffurnt. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, my aged friend; why should
you accuse me of playing durn tricks on people?
To what circumstance do you allude?"</p>

<p>"I ain't alludin' to nothin; I says it out
plain. If ye don't know, Id'no as I'm called
to tell ye. Me an' Hartman was gittin on fust
rate, till ye come and upsot us; we ain't used
to bein upsot. So when our commydations
wan't good enough for ye an' yer gells, ye
went and got Hartman down thar in the city,
or wharever 'twas. An' Id'no what ye done
to him thar, an' I spose it's no good to ask a
feller like ye; but he ain't ben the same man
sence. That's how <i>he</i> is. He uster be chipper,
an' peart, an' clost frens with me; an' now he
don't say nothin. Ye can see fur yerself pooty
durn soon."</p>

<p>And the native bestowed on me a malign
glance. I trotted him out and entertained
myself with his paces (which were livelier than
those of his nag) for the next three hours.
Those who like nature unadorned can find it
here. As a specimen of unbridled rancor
Hodge deserves a prize. I believe I have got
to the bottom of his luminous intellect&mdash;not
that it was worth the labor, if one had anything
else to do. Supposing himself Jim's most intimate
friend, he is jealous of me as a rival in
that capacity; and he has never forgiven the
slight put on his establishment in connection
with the girls' proposed visit. I partly appeased
him by suggesting that he supply the shanty
with a new signboard labeled 'Palace Hotel.'
Fortunately I don't have to put up there this
time.</p>

<p>Of course he told me a lot of lies. A casual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
eye could see no change in the recluse: his head
does not hang down on his breast, his locks are
not long and matted, his sighs do not resound
through the primeval forest and scare away
the panthers. When you look closely at him,
or have been with him long enough, you can
see that he is a little thinner, a little older, a
little less inclined to chaff&mdash;as well he may be.
Chaffing is a bad habit anyway, and was his
worst fault when I was here before; so far, his
woes have improved him. He met me cordially
enough, but with no wild demonstration: he
seems no nearer insanity than last May. He
asked after Mabel, Jane, and the children, but
not after Clarice; nor did I mention her, of
course. It was not a very pleasant evening, for
each of us was watching the other to see what
he would say. He knows as well as I do that
the enemy has troops in reserve: he is not so
unsuspicious as he was. He did not ventilate
his theories to any great extent, nor did I see
my way to expound my great scheme for the
Ascertainment of Truth: the ground ought to
be in good condition before you drop seed of
such value upon it.</p>

<p>If I thought things would go on like this,
I should begin to grumble; but we shall probably
get broken in to each other in a day or
two, and then I can thaw him out. We talked
glittering generalities for a while&mdash;the weather,
and the war prospects abroad, and the chances
of getting deer on the other side of a mountain
not far away&mdash;like any commonplace boobies
at a county fair. Then he proposed for next
morning a stream I had not seen, some distance
off, which would necessitate a start before daybreak:
so I pretended to be tired from the
journey, and we turned in early.</p>

<h3><a name="A_Wild_Brook" id="A_Wild_Brook"></a>XXV.</h3>

<h4>A WILD BROOK.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day we went some miles along a lonely
road, and then through the fields of an abandoned
farm. I don't wonder they abandoned
it; I am only sorry for the poor wretch who
once cherished the delusive dream of scratching
a living there; when he died or went back to
Canada, he couldn't well be worse off. Nature
had but partially reclaimed the land, and we
tramped through weeds and grass up to our
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: punctuation in the original is unclear here">middle;</ins> one might as well be wading a fair-sized
river. You have no idea of the dew up
here till you have tried it. After a while we
struck into the woods, and such woods you
never saw&mdash;at least I hope so for your sake.
Rocks, big and little, generally of the most
unchristian shapes&mdash;not picturesque, but sprawling;
underbrush wherever it had a chance to
grow: you could scarcely find a foot of smooth
ground. The worst of it was the way the trees
lay around loose. The region had not been
burned over, at least not for many years; but
it did seem to have been cursed, as if Adam's
fall had been enacted there. The monarchs of
the forest, for countless generations, had indulged
a depraved propensity to fall also, and
across each other in all possible directions. It
was such an abattis as I trust our men, in the
war, never had to fight their way through:
here it was bad enough without anybody to
shoot at you. I would go rods out of my way
to get around a great bowlder, and come upon
a conglomeration of big trees which had tumbled
about till they made a Virginia fence
fifteen feet high. Climbing is all very well in
its way, but I don't like this kind. The queer
thing was that they had not the sense to decay
and crumble; the wood was mostly sound enough
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to be standing yet. I asked Hartman why
they did not haul off all this timber, and he
said there was no place to haul it to, nor any
way to haul it, nor anybody to do the hauling;
that fuel was cheap, and the few inhabitants
had plenty nearer home; and besides, that it
was most ornamental and useful where it was&mdash;it
afforded exercise to the bodily and spiritual
muscles of any anglers from the city who might
come that way like me. "You forget the
characteristics of this region, which are its
advantages in my view. You can get turnpike
roads, and teams, and sawmills, nearer home.
You come up here to be away from the busy
haunts, you know, and to see Nature in her
native purity. This stream that I am taking
you to is very seldom visited."</p>

<p>"I should think it would be, if this is the
way to get to it," I said, as I fell over a root
and barked my nose and knees. "What the
deuce did we come to such a blanked place
for?"</p>

<p>"For trout: you said they were what you
wanted. The less fishermen, the more fish.
This is the best brook in the county, because it
is the least accessible. I rarely come here
myself: I've been saving it up this year for
you."</p>

<p>We went on, our progress marked by frequent
delays and accidents; that it was marked by no
profanity was due merely to Jim's reticence
and to my exceptional manners and principles.
After what seemed to me about twenty miles&mdash;though
he said it was only one and a half&mdash;of
this singularly forsaken country, he cried,
"Look out now, or you'll fall in. Here is the
brook."</p>

<p>It made noise enough to be heard a long way
off, but I thought that was something else&mdash;some
kobolds or other abnormal beings, probably,
working at their forges underground.
The brook itself was well enough, but it did
not seem to belong there; you could not see it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
till you were on the edge of it. I have fished
a good many streams, and tramped through all
sorts of woods, but I never saw such a place as
that before, and I never want to again. We
had left our rods at home; high-toned anglers
who carry fancy tackle through such regions
leave it along the painful way in small pieces.
So we carried merely our baskets&mdash;which were
encumbrance enough&mdash;and what we had in our
pockets. You can cut a pole anywhere, and it
does not want to be a long one either: take
your fly-book if you like, but worms are as good
or better. There was no use of wading: you
would be more likely to scare the fish so than
by staying on the bank, where they could never
see you; the difficulty was to see far enough to
throw in five feet of line. It was a superior
brook&mdash;all but the getting to it, and, as I afterwards
found, away from it. If it could be removed
from its loathsome surroundings and put
down in a decent country, I would go there every
year. I was going to say that some of the
cascades were forty feet high, till I remembered
that trout cannot climb as far as that.</p>

<p>"Don't lose your balance," said Jim; "these
fish are fierce." They were, in the wilder parts.
They would bite like mad, and then wriggle
and wrench themselves off the hook before you
could get them up the bank. I never saw or
heard of such ferocity, except in the celebrated
scaly warrior which chased an equally famous
fisherman all over an Adirondack lake, jumped
across his boat several times, and, if I remember
rightly, bit him on the nose. No such adventure
fell to my lot on this occasion, though I
thought that some of them, when sufficiently
near my face, grinned at me as they parted
company. Yet none of them were over half a
pound, and most of them much less. You can
see that this healthful pastime does not produce
its usual demoralizing effect on me. When
we reached a flat piece of ground, the water
would become quiet and the manners of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
fish more humane, so that they would come out
like chubs. I stood in one spot under a tree,
and took twenty-nine in succession. My sister,
looking over these memoirs, suggests that they
probably <i>were</i> chubs; but Hartman, who was
behind me then, came up and saw them, so I have
his evidence. He said it was a spawning bed,
and I ought to put the twenty-nine back. Who
would have thought him capable of such mean
jealousy? But he cannot play his tricks on
me.</p>

<p>About two P.M. he said we had better start.</p>

<p>"Why, we don't want to reach home much
before dark," said I.</p>

<p>"No danger of it. It's much worse getting
out of this than getting in. You saw how
much path there is: we can't go straight, and
it's all chance where we strike the fields.
You'd better eat what you've got, and drink
all you can: there's no water between this and
the road."</p>

<p>"Didn't you take landmarks? Look at the
mountains all round."</p>

<p>"They are like the mountains about the Dark
Tower Childe Roland came to. I've been here
twice before, and missed the way back both times.
Nobody ever got out of here without going a
circuit to the right, and taking his chances.
The natives are afraid to come here: they say
there are ghosts&mdash;the ghosts of those who got
lost of old, and were eaten by bears. That's
how we took so many trout. Look to your belt
now, and the straps of your basket. The last
time I was here, the other fellow lost his fish
in the woods, and I made him go back and
hunt them up: it was near night before he
found them, and his basket was not much
heavier than yours is now. If we should have
to camp out, we can build a fire, cook some of
the fish, and probably avoid freezing: but we'd
better try to get out."</p>

<p>I thought so too, and supposed he was trying
to scare me; but the sun was nearly down when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
we saw the fields. We went four times too far,
through that beastly region of rocks and dead
trees: I think our course was mainly northwest
by south-southeast. At last we got back to
the house, tired and hungry; but Jim's old
housekeeper is a pretty good cook for a native,
and there is no better supper than trout that
were in the water the same day.</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="An_Intractable_Patient" id="An_Intractable_Patient"></a>XXVI.</h3>

<h4>AN INTRACTABLE PATIENT.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we were settled down to our pipes, I
said, "Is this the way you treat the friends
of your youth, when they entrust life and limb
to your hospitality?"</p>

<p>"I give 'em the best I've got: sorry if it
doesn't suit. There's no Delmonico's round the
corner, here. What's the matter with you, old
man?"</p>

<p>"O, it's not your housekeeping: that's all
right. But why did you lead me such a dance,
and get me lost in that unconscionable doghole
of a wilderness?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever take so many fish out of a
brook in one day before? No, of course you
didn't. Well, that's why. I told you it would
be a rough expedition; but I thought you
came here to rough it. You didn't expect balls
and a casino, did you? You were here last
May."</p>

<p>"Last May I saw nothing as bad as this to-day.
You haven't been playing it on me, I
hope? Jim, have you got any grudge against
me?"</p>

<p>"What should I have? You're deucedly suspicious
and sensitive&mdash;far more so than I was
with you. I believe I let you play on me to
your heart's content, and never complained&mdash;did
I?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"Jim, I don't like this. There's a change
in you: Hodge said so, and I didn't believe
him. You're not the same man."</p>

<p>"O, we all change&mdash;from year to year, and
from day to day. But I ought never to have
left these woods, Bob, and that's the truth.
You should have let me stay here as I was."</p>

<p>"I meant it in all kindness, for your good,
Jim. Surely you'll do me the justice to acknowledge
that."</p>

<p>"No doubt. But your philanthropic experiments
are apt to be damnably expensive to the
patient."</p>

<p>"You couldn't be much worse than you were,
according to your own account. Any change
ought to have been for the better."</p>

<p>"That was your assumption. Do I strike
you as being changed for the better?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, you don't&mdash;not to put too fine a
point upon it."</p>

<p>He certainly does not. His whole manner
is altered. His former gentleness has given
way to rough harshness. You have seen how
he treats me. It may be his best, as he says;
if so, his best is far from good. His bitterness
used to be, if I may say so, in the abstract,
and leveled against abstractions; now it seems
to have a painfully concrete character and aim.
His estrangement from the scheme of things,
or from his kind at least, was purely intellectual,
leaving his heart no more affected than the
heart usually is by brain-disorders; now it is
moral. He is like a man tormented by remorse,
or regrets as savage. But I think I know a
cure for his complaint.</p>

<p>After a pause he said, "I don't want to blame
you, Bob, and I don't propose to whine. Nor
was it any great matter what came to me,
wherever it might come from. I thought I
was done with the world, and had nothing to
fear from it, except being bored and disgusted.
There was only one thing I cared about, and
that I supposed I could keep. I was mistaken.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
It was my little ewe lamb&mdash;all I had; and they
took it from me."</p>

<p>"I thought your live stock was confined to
dogs, and a cow, and the tomcat&mdash;by the way,
I don't see him any more. I didn't know you
went into sheep. Was Tommy the ewe-lamb,
and did the dogs play Nathan and David with
him?"</p>

<p>This I said, thinking to cheer him up a bit;
but he only scowled. Really, I must remember
Mabel's caution about telling the wrong stories
and laughing in the wrong places. "Well,
Jim, what was 'it' that you valued so, and who
were 'they' who took it away?"</p>

<p>"The prince of the power of the air; the
spirit that walks in darkness, and rules in the
children thereof. The beautiful order of things
generally, and their incurable depravity. All
these are one, and the name doesn't matter.
If you urged me to it, I might say that you had
played a very passable David to my Uriah."</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;I? I'm not a sheep-stealer. What
would I want to hurt you for? Jim, you're
joking, and it's a joke of doubtful taste."</p>

<p>"Do I look like it? <i>You</i> might find a joke
in this: you can find them everywhere. I
can't."</p>

<p>"As I told you, you take Life too seriously.
If you will be more specific, and tell me what
you have lost, perhaps I can help you to find
it."</p>

<p>"Some losses are irrecoverable. You'd better
let it alone, Bob; you'd better have let me
alone before, as I've said. You mean well
enough; but it's ill meddling with another
man's life. You don't know what responsibility
you take, or what effect you may produce.
I don't say that it's the worst of all possible
worlds, but it is such that each of us had best
go his own way, and keep clear of the others.
When one forgets that safe rule, and mixes with
his kind, only harm seems to come of it."</p>

<p>"If that is so, I might better have staid at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
home now. Methinks your written hand is
different from your spoken. I mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O yes, when I write I try to come out of
myself and be decently civil; and so I should
to a chance visitor for five minutes, or an hour
maybe. But I can't keep it up all day&mdash;not to
say for a week. You'll have to see the facts,
and bear with them. I don't want to be rough
on you; but I'm not myself&mdash;or not what I
was before, or supposed myself to be. It's all
in the plan, no doubt; we are fulfilling the
beneficent intentions of Nature. Perhaps I'm
breaking down, and the end is not so far off as
we thought. If so, so much the better: we'll
escape that sad old age you prophesied."</p>

<p>Now I am not lacking in humanity, but it
does not afflict me as it did six months ago to
hear Jim go on in this way. I know what is
the matter with him now, and what he is
driving at, though I must assume ignorance for
a while yet. The patient must tell his symptoms,
and then the doctor will give him the
physic he needs, and proceed to make a new
man of him. That is what I am after now,
and the good work must not be spoiled by undue
haste. So I put on a decorous air of sympathy,
and said,</p>

<p>"That's all bosh, you know. If anything is
the matter with you physically, I ought to hear
about it; but I don't believe there is. As for the
mind, we are all subject to gloomy moods and
periods of depression; but they pass, Jim&mdash;they
pass. You believed in friendship before; hadn't
you better tell me what you think ails you?"</p>

<p>"I can't talk about it, except in this roundabout
way: what's the use? Best keep to
broad principles: the particular case only illustrates
the general law. I knew it of old: what
business had I to expose myself again? What
would you do with a child who will keep on
playing about moving cars, or mill machinery?
Let him fall under the wheels, and rid the
earth of an idiot."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
"O no: pull him out in time, and he'll learn
better. Well, Jim, you might at least tell me
what hand I had in this catastrophe."</p>

<p>"O, none, none whatever: how should you?
You never laid any plots for me, and used me
for your mirth. You never devised an elaborately
concealed ambush, and smoothed it over
till I was in the snare. That would be foreign
to your open and candid nature. It is very
good fun to practice on unsuspecting innocence;
but you are far above that."</p>

<p>"See here, Hartman: you talk as if my house
were a den of iniquity. If so, I was not aware
of it till now. Your ill opinion has not thus
far been reciprocated. We entertain none but
kind feelings toward you: we all regretted your
hasty departure. You were received as a
friend, and treated as such, I believe. My wife
and sister often speak of you: you could command
their fullest sympathy in this, or any
trouble, real or imaginary."</p>

<p>"That I never doubted: I owe them nothing
but pleasant memories, and thankful good
will.&mdash;You need not stare at me so: I make no
charges, and imply none.&mdash;Well, if you must
have it, I can say that every member of your
family has my absolute respect,&mdash;down to the
twins; do you understand? If I have any
grudge, it is toward you alone."</p>

<p>It was plain that he forced himself to say
this&mdash;or some of it&mdash;as if it were coming perilously
near a name he could not utter. He is
having his bad time now, as I had mine last
week. It is his own fault: he has no need to
be so censorious. He <i>had</i> to say what he did,
or there would be trouble: some things a man
cannot stand, and my best friend would be my
friend no longer, if he ventured to reflect upon
the Princess.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say so: the difficulty
is simple then, and easily settled. You've got
no pistols, of course, and I didn't bring mine.
I'll take your rifle, and you can borrow Hodge's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
old shotgun: if it bursts, it won't be much loss&mdash;only
you mustn't come too near me with it.
There's no danger of interference from the
police up here, I judge? But I say, what shall
we do for a surgeon?"</p>

<p>"There you go again, turning everything into
a jest. Can you never be serious, man?"</p>

<p>"Try to say something original, James: that
is stale. Jane asks me that about six times a
day, and Mabel frequently, and&mdash;and the others.
I was serious with you just now, or nearly: had
I been entirely so, I might have knocked the
top of your head off, and then they would have
blamed me at home. You see, they think you
are more of a man than you show yourself. To
be serious all the time is the most serious mistake
one can make in life; and I want no worse
example than you. When I go back to town I
shall write the Decline and Fall of an Alleged
Seeker after Truth, who missed it by taking
things too seriously. You are too stiff and narrow
and rigid and dogmatic: you take one point
of view and stick to it like grim death. You
can't get at Truth in that way."</p>

<p>"I suppose you would stand on your head and
look at it upside down, and then turn a back
somersault and view it from between your
legs."</p>

<p>"You express it inelegantly, but you have
caught the idea. Truth is not a half pound package
done up in brown paper and permanently
deposited in one corner of the pantry shelf;
she is big and various and active. While you
have your head fixed in the iron grip and are
staring at the sign 'Terms Cash,' she is off to
the other side of the room&mdash;and you don't
make a good picture at all in that constrained
attitude. Your mind has got to be nimble and
unbiassed if you want to overtake her, because
she is always changing: that is, she appears in
new and&mdash;to you&mdash;unexpected places. I gave
you a hint of this in May, and another last
summer, but you seem to have forgotten it. O,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
I could sit here all night and explain it
to you, if you were in the right frame of
mind."</p>

<p>"No doubt: happily I am not. What has
this to do with your defence of buffoonery,
and apotheosis of clowns and pantomimes?"</p>

<p>"A pantomime is a very good thing in its
way. But that is your illustration; I would
rather say opera bouffe, which is probably the
truest copy of Life&mdash;if we were limited to one
kind. But we are not: I tell you, we must
have all sorts. There is tragedy in Life, and
comedy&mdash;that more especially; a little of the
other goes a long way. But they are always
mixed&mdash;not kept apart, and one alone taken in
large and frequent doses, after your fashion.
Shakespeare understood his business pretty
well; though, if I had been he, I would have
put in more of those light and graceful touches
which hit us where we live, and make the
whole world kin."</p>

<p>"Like the Dromios, or the Carriers in Henry
Fourth."</p>

<p>"Or the Gravediggers; they are more to your
purpose. I want you to see that Humor is the
general solvent and reconciler, the key that
opens most locks: a feeling for it, well developed,
would be money in your pocket. Things
don't go to suit you, and you think your powers
of the air are frowning, the universe a vault,
and the canopy a funeral pall: perhaps the
powers are only laughing at you, and want you
to smile with them. If you could do that, it
would let in light on your darkness. Any
situation, properly viewed, has its amusing
elements: if you ignore them, you fail to understand
the whole. What did Heine say
about his irregular Latin nouns? That his
knowledge of them, in many a gloomy hour,
supplied much inward consolation and delight.
You ought to read him more, Jim."</p>

<p>"And Josh Billings, and Bill Nye. Well,
that's enough of your wisdom for to-night.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
We must arrange for to-morrow. Are you up
to another <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: scramble.?'' with a period">scramble</ins>?"</p>

<p>"Not like to-day's. Let's take in some
decent scenery along with the trout."</p>

<p>"There is a wild gorge ten miles off, with a
brook in it. We can take Hodge's mare, put up
at a house, and work down the ravine. It's not
so bad as the last place, nor so good for fish."
I agreed, and we went to bed.</p>

<p>You may think I am humoring Hartman too
much, and letting him shirk the subject. But
I have a week&mdash;more if necessary&mdash;and I don't
want to be too hard on him. He'll thaw out
by degrees: so long as he doesn't blame Clarice,
it is all right. He has got my idea about the
way to discover Truth now, and it will work
in his brain, and soften him. I know Jim: he
never seems to take hold at first, but he comes
round in time. You just wait, and you will
see whether I know what I am about.</p>

<h4>SCENERY IMPROVED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day we drove to a farmhouse which
had annexed some rather decent fields for that
region. On one side was tolerably level ground,
on the other a cut between two savage mountains.
Down this we made our way, taking
presently the bed of a small brook: woodroad
or footpath never can be there. For a while
there was room to walk on dry land: soon the
cliffs closed in upon us, <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'or'">on</ins> the right rising
sheer, on the left sloping, but steeper than I
would want to climb. At first the stream was
very shallow and narrow, and the fish small
and scarce; but think of the creatures that
must come there to drink at night! It was the
only watercourse for miles, Jim said. He
pointed out the tracks of a bear or two, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
he thought of a panther; but it is not here I
should choose to hunt&mdash;your game might have
you at a disadvantage. He tried to make me
believe that even now some of these beasts
might catch us; but that was simply to discourage
me from going after them, later on:
Jim does not like the chase. <i>My</i> jokes are in
better taste: as he is now, I believe the bears
could beat him in manners. Near noon we
found a place to sit down, where we could see
a little of the crags, and proceeded to assimilate
our frugal lunch.</p>

<p>"Hartman," said I, "I should think you
would want to live up to your scenery, as the
ladies do to their blue china. Look at this
majestic cliff, whose scarred and aged front,
frowning upon these lonesome trout since the
creation, has never been profaned by mortal
foot."</p>

<p>"Probably not. People very seldom come
here, and when they do, they wouldn't be fools
enough to try to climb up. They couldn't do
it, and it wouldn't pay if they could."</p>

<p>"Well, it is grand, anyway, and it ought to
quicken your soul to grand thoughts. In such
a scene you ought to feel stirring within you
noble sympathies and resolves."</p>

<p>"I can't see much grandeur in human nature,
Bob, nor any in myself. If you had thought
yourself a gentleman, and suddenly awaked to
the fact that you were a cad and a scoundrel,
you would be apt to change your tune, and
drop the high notes."</p>

<p>Oho, I thought, he is coming to the point.
While I was meditating how to utilize this
confidence, a small piece of rock fell from above
upon the edge of my toes: if it had been a
large piece, and fallen on my head, you would
have missed this moral tale. When I had expressed
my sentiments, he said, "I can't insure
you against accidents,&mdash;any more than
you did me. If I had brought you here in
spring, you might growl. The rocks are loose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
then, and it is dangerous. A man was killed
once just below here, and his body never found
till the year after." This trivial <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'occurence'">occurrence</ins>
seemed to turn his thoughts away from the
important topic, and I could not get him back
to it.</p>

<p>It was a warm day for the season: once in a
while it will be hotter in these sylvan solitudes
than it is in New York. While we were in
the brook we did not mind that, for we could
drop every five minutes and drink. I suppose I
consumed some nine gallons of <i>aqua pura</i>
during the morning: you can do this with impunity,
because there is no ice in it, and the
bacteria are of the most wholesome kind. But
by and by we finished with the gorge: then we
had to go across a sort of common, up hill.
There was no water now, and it was hot. After
more trees, and a steeper ascent, Jim said,
"You'll get a view now." We came out on an
open place, with steep rocks beneath. Before
us lay a wilderness, with clearings here and
there, and a background of mountains. The
forests were in their early November bloom;
the country looked one great flower. In the
Alps or the Rockies they can give this odds,
and beat it easily, but it was pretty well for
eastern America&mdash;and an occasion to be improved.
"Jim, if the crags don't appeal to
you, this might. If you don't feel up to moral
grandeur, why not go in for peace? Let your
perturbed spirit catch the note of harmony
from this landscape, and drink in purity from
this air."</p>

<p>"That is all very fine, and you would make
a pretty fair exhorter&mdash;with practice. But
natural theology is not in my line. These hills
look nicely now, but it will be different within
a month. If I am to learn peace from a fine
day, what from a stormy one? Nature changes
for the worse like us, and with less shame: she
has no regrets for the past, no care to keep up
appearances or make a show of consistency."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
"I fear you have been learning of Nature on
her wrong side then. Half confidences are in
bad taste, Jim. What is it you keep hinting
at? It ought to be murder, from the airs you
put on about it."</p>

<p>"Leave that for to-night, when we have
nothing better to attend to. There is another
brook here we ought to try."</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="Diplomacy" id="Diplomacy"></a>XXVIII.</h3>

<h4>DIPLOMACY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> got back reasonably early, much less tired
than the day before. Now, I thought, for
some progress. "Well, Jim, you wanted to
unfold your tale to-night."</p>

<p>"That is, you wanted to ask me about it.
You can't do any good, and I don't find speech
a safety-valve: but I suppose it is my duty to
supply you with amusement. So get on, and
say what is on your mind."</p>

<p>He takes this tone to conceal his morbid
yearning to ease his bosom of its perilous stuff:
I will have his coil unwound pretty soon. If
I were not here, he would probably be whispering
her name under the solemn stars, and
shouting it in tragic tones on the lonely mountain-top;
sighing it under the waterfalls, and
expecting the trout to echo it. He talks about
fishing the home brook the first rainy day, but
he must have scared all the fish away from
there with his sentiment. I must remember
to notice whether 'C. E.' is carved about the
forest. He will pretend to hold back; but I
will get it out of him.&mdash;I made this pause long
enough to let him prepare for the examination
on which depends his admission into the civil
service, so to speak&mdash;he will have to be more
civil and serviceable than hitherto if he is to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
pass it, and follow me back to town&mdash;and indeed
his whole future.</p>

<p>"You say you have lost something valuable.
All you had, you said it was; but that is nonsense.
You have health, and more money than
you want, and brains and education, of which
you are making very poor use, and friends,
whom you are treating badly. I can't think
what you have lost&mdash;unless it was your heart,
perhaps." This I brought in in the way of
afterthought, as if it had suddenly occurred to
me. He started, but assumed a tone of cynical
indifference.</p>

<p>"My heart? Would I sit down and howl over
that? What use have I for a heart, any more
than for a poodle? And if I had one, what
does it matter what may have become of it?"</p>

<p>"Strayed or stolen, probably. Such things
have happened, especially when persons of the
opposite sex are about. They are apt to attach
themselves to poodles, and vice versa. But if
you give me your honor that a loss of heart is
not the cause of these lamentations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why will you press that point, Bob? What
is done can't be undone, and what is broken
can't be mended."</p>

<p>"And what is crooked can't be made straight,
and what is wanting can't be supplied; though
these things are done every day and every hour.
Why any able-bodied lady of my acquaintance,
even those at my own house, limited as is their
experience of the world's devious ways&mdash;Jane,
I mean, or Mabel&mdash;could tell you how."</p>

<p>"Robert, I am too old for these follies."</p>

<p>"James, you are the youngest man I ever
knew. Any boy of eighteen would be apt to
know better how to manage such matters, and&mdash;if
you will pardon the frankness you employ
yourself&mdash;to exhibit more sense."</p>

<p>He stared a little, and I gave him time to
recover. Then he took up his parable, defensively
falling back on the abstract, after his
manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
"Of course I have thought of these things,
Bob, and the philosophy of them, if they can
be said to have any. They seem much like
everything else. Taking Life in its unfinancial
aspects, men do things, not because the particular
things are worth doing, but as an
apology for the unwarranted liberty they take
in being alive. 'I am: why am I?' said the
youth at prayer-meeting, and everybody gave
it up. As an effort toward answering his own
conundrum, he entered the ministry. Being
alive, we have to make a pretense of doing
something, which else might better remain
undone. That is why books are written, and
controversies waged; it explains most of our
intellectual and moral activities. So with
society: time must be killed, and we go out
for an evening, though we are dreadfully bored
and gain nothing at all. So, I suppose, with
what is called love. The emotional part of our
nature, which is the absurdest part of all,
finds or fancies itself unemployed: a void craves
and aches in the breast, and the man, as an old
farmer once expressed it, is 'kinder lovesick
for suthin he ain't got and dunno what.'
Almost any material of the other sex, if you
allow a little for taste and temperament, will
fill the void&mdash;in a way, and for a time at least.
Darby marries Joan and is content, though any
other woman would have served his turn as well.
With us of the finer feelings and higher
standards, the only difference is that we rant
more and sophisticate more, as belongs to our
wider range. No one ever felt thus before&mdash;because
the feeling is new to us, and newer
each time it comes: so Festus protests to each
successive mistress, perjuring himself in all
sincerity. Nor was any mistress ever so beautiful
and divine as this one, appointed to possess
and be adored by us. All that is purely a
mental exercise: carry the illusion a little farther,
and it might be practised as well on a milliner's
lay-figure. 'He that loves a coral cheek or a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ruby lip admires' is simply a red hot donkey, Bob.
Nature provides the imbecile desire, Propinquity
furnishes an object at random. Imagination
does all the rest."</p>

<p>"Just so, Jim. I am glad to find you again
capable of such lucid and exhaustive analysis.
But how about what is called <i>falling</i> in love,
when the wild ass has not been craving to have
his void filled up at all, but is suddenly brought
down unawares by an Amazonian arrow?"</p>

<p>"He was no less a donkey that he didn't
know it, and it only comes harder for him.
The fool ought to have been better acquainted
with his own interior condition; then he might
have eased his descent to his royal thistle, secured
his repast or gone without it, and got
back to his stable with a whole skin. Otherwise
it is just the same. The heart is an idiot baby,
Robert: it feeds on pap and thinks it is guzzling
nectar on Olympus."</p>

<p>"Exactly, James; exactly. As you say, it is
our fertile fancy that does it all. You and I
can conjure up women far more charming than
we ever met on brick or carpet. If we only
had the raw material and knew how to work it
up, we could beat these flesh and blood girls
off the field before breakfast. Their merits
and attractions are mainly such as we generously
invest them with; and often they take a mean
advantage of our kindness."</p>

<p>I glanced at him sideways, and he flushed
and winced. "I would not derogate from
women, nor rate myself so high. I meant only
that we imagine&mdash;well, monstrous heaps of
nonsense. For instance, we often fancy that
they care for us when they don't&mdash;and whose
fault is that but ours? There's a deal of rot
talked about lords of creation&mdash;when a man
isn't able to be lord of himself. O, women are
very well in their way: I've nothing against
them. They are just as good as we&mdash;better,
very likely; and wiser, for they don't idealize
us as we do them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
"Yes, but this idealizing faculty is a very
useful one to have. I see you must have found
a Blowsalinda on some of these hill farms:&mdash;why,
man, you're as red as her father's beets.
I congratulate you, Jim: I do, heartily. As you
say, the tender passion is merely a spark struck
by the flint of Opportunity on the steel of
Desire; and for the rest, you can enrich her
practical native virtues with the golden hues of
your imagination. She'll suit you just as well
as any of these proud cityfied damsels&mdash;after
you've sent her a term or two to boarding
school; and she'll be more content to stay up
here than the city girl would."</p>

<p>I paused to view my work, and was satisfied.
The shadows of wrath and disgust were chasing
each other over my friend's intelligent countenance.
You see, I get so browbeaten at home
that I must avenge myself on somebody now
and then; and of course, it has to be a man.
And then it is all for Jim's good, and he deserves
all he is getting. So I went on.</p>

<p>"But seeing this is so, Jim, you ought to be
content; and what means all your wild talk of
last night and this morning, as if you had
something on your conscience? You haven't&mdash;you
wouldn't&mdash;No, you're not that kind of
a man. Well then, what in thunder have you
been making all this fuss about, and pitching
into me for?"</p>

<p>He suppressed something with a gulp: I
think it was not an expression of gratitude or
affection. "Confound you, Bob; one never
knows how to take you. In the name of
Satan and all the devils, what are you after
now?"</p>

<p>"I'm not after anything in the name of the
gentlemen you mention; they are no friends of
mine, nor objects of my regard. Put a better
name on it, and I'm after getting you to say
what you mean, as we agreed&mdash;though it seems
to be hard work. Who's playing tricks upon
travellers, and misleading a confiding friend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
now? I never knew such a man for beating
about the bush, and talking nonsense." (I
remembered this apothegm of Jane's, which
sounded well, and fitted in nicely just
here.)</p>

<p>He appeared to take himself to pieces, shake
them well, and put them together carefully,
before he spoke. "Perhaps my language was
obscure, or even enigmatical; but I thought
you might understand. Forgive me if I have
been harsh, Bob, not to say uncivil: I have
gone through a good deal, until I hardly know
myself. It is base enough for a man to be thus
at the mercy of mere externals&mdash;and I used to
think I could practice the Stoic doctrine! But
to be human is to be a pitiable, and, if you like,
a despicable creature. I knew a case that may
serve in a way to explain&mdash;not to justify&mdash;my
treatment of you. Say it was years ago; the
man met, in a friend's house, a lady who
showed him the utmost kindness. She was
used to all deference, till she and every one regarded
it as her right&mdash;as it was. And he&mdash;it's
not pleasant to tell&mdash;he ended by insulting her.
I always understood how that fellow never could
bear to mention her name, nor to hear it; how
any reminder of her, or contact with the friends
through whom <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'he met he met'">he met</ins> her, would upset
him. He would get confused, and some of his
self-reproaches would fall on the wrong heads.
I suppose you never knew how that could be,
Bob."</p>

<p>"I never was in exactly such a scrape as that;
but I've been near enough to imagine, and
make allowances. Your friend must have
thought a good deal of the lady, in spite
of his insulting her. He apologized, of
course?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and then took himself off, and
kept out of her way ever after. It was all he
could do."</p>

<p>"Just how did he insult her? It could
hardly have been intentional."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
"O no. He had had misfortunes, or <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'some thing'">something</ins>
of the kind, and she took a humane interest
in him&mdash;tried to help him, no doubt.
Women often do such things, I believe; it is
very creditable to them, but liable to be
dangerous in a case like this, for men are sometimes
fools enough to misinterpret it. Well,
this particular beast took it into his wooden
head that she cared for him&mdash;in a personal
way, you know; and&mdash;you wouldn't think a
man could be such an infernal ape, would you?&mdash;he
told her so."</p>

<p>"He planned beforehand to tell her so&mdash;thought
that was the right card to play, the
proper way of wooing?"</p>

<p>"You make him worse than he was. It came
out unawares&mdash;he was surprised into it. The
conversation took a certain turn, and he misunderstood
for a moment. That was all, and
it was quite enough."</p>

<p>"What did the lady do then?"</p>

<p>"She was naturally and properly indignant
and contemptuous; made him see his place.
He took it, and took his departure."</p>

<p>"Did it never enter your friend's wise head
that he might have mismanaged the affair in
some other way than the one you mention; for
instance, in going off so speedily?"</p>

<p>"No other course was possible. Enough of
this, Bob: he bore the penalty of his offence."</p>

<p>"Excuse me: it's a curious case, and as a
student of human nature I like to study such,
and master all the facts. You say it never
occurred to him that the worst part of his
offence might be his levanting in such haste?
that it might have been a more appropriate
act of penitence to wait a day, or five minutes,
and give the lady a chance to forgive
him?"</p>

<p>"How can you make such low suggestions?
The man was not a scoundrel at heart: at least
he had always passed for a gentleman before,
and thought himself such."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
"For one who goes about insulting ladies, he
was a singularly modest youth. So he never
thought afterwards that there might have been
a basis of fact for the fancy that made the
trouble?"</p>

<p>"Drop the subject, will you? I brought it
in merely as an illustration, that you might
see how a man can be affected&mdash;even his character
changed&mdash;by the recollection of such a
blunder. It would destroy his self-respect."</p>

<p>"Naturally. But self-respect is too good a
thing to lose forever, and this illustration of
yours may serve to pass the time till you are
ready to talk of your own affairs, which you
say it somehow illustrates. Did your friend
never think that the girl might have led him
on, either seriously or for mere amusement?
If she did, that would be some excuse for
him."</p>

<p>"I tell you he was not that kind of a blackguard.
All sorts of thoughts will offer themselves
to a man in such a state of mind, I suppose;
but he knew her too well to admit any
that lowered her. O no, he saw the fault was
all his. At the moment he was bewildered,
and could not realize the sudden change, nor
what he had done; so his apology (if I remember
that part of his story) may have been inadequate
in manner, however suitable in words.
Apart from that, which could not be mended
afterwards, he did all he possibly could."</p>

<p>"I beg to differ, Jim. I think this fellow
did much worse than you seem to realize.
Stare as much as you like: if he is still a
friend of yours, I am sorry for him, as for one
who has committed a most outrageous blunder
and a nearly unpardonable wrong. What right
had he to think of himself alone? You say
the girl had shown goodness of heart, and a
real interest in him? Then suppose the interest
went no further than he thought: what business
had he to burden her mind with a broken
friendship and the feeling that she had helped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to spoil his life? Or suppose the interest in
him did go further. What do you and he
know about a woman's feelings?"</p>

<p>He was pale now, and wild in the eyes.
"Your last supposition is impossible. For the
other&mdash;you may possibly be right. He never
thought she would care&mdash;or that he could
do anything but what he did."</p>

<p>"A nice lot he is then. If I were you, I
would write to him to-morrow and give him a
lecture&mdash;supposing they are both alive and free.
And if this affair was anyway parallel to your
own, of which you won't talk, I hope it may
be a lesson to you&mdash;a warning, if you need
one. Do you suppose women, of the high-minded
and superior sort, have no hearts, no
consciences, no sense of the duties of humanity?
They have a blanked sight more than you and
your friend seem to have, I can tell you.
You'd better sleep on this, and wake with
some enlarged ideas. As you decline to tell
me anything of yourself, and so I can't help
you there, I'm going to bed."</p>

<h3><a name="Submission" id="Submission"></a>XXIX.</h3>

<h4>SUBMISSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> day Jim was haggard and restless, and
wanted to potter about the house. I took him
to the largest stream in those parts, when our
rods came in play; and there he did some of
the worst fishing I ever saw&mdash;worse than I did
in May, when I had him on my mind. He
has himself on his mind now, and some one else
too. He kept trying to talk, which is impossible
when you are wading. After he had lost a
two-pounder and fallen into a deep hole, I got
out on the bank to avoid a place where the
water went down hill too fast&mdash;something between
rapids and a cascade. He came and sat
on a log by me, looking disconsolate.</p>

<p>"Jim," I said, "You're pretty wet. Perhaps
you'd better go home and write that letter."</p>

<p>"I don't see my way yet. How can you be
so positive?"</p>

<p>"Because I've heard the story before, and
know more about it than you do. I had a
friend who was there at the time too. O, it
caused some talk, I can tell you. Did your
hero suppose it would interest nobody but himself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as I told you. Good heavens! You
don't mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, no public talk; only the family, and
people who knew the facts and could be trusted.
They were all sorry for him too; they thought
he was such an ass. You see a performance
like his can't end where it begins; it has consequences."</p>

<p>"You say, 'for him too.' They couldn't be
sorry for the lady&mdash;why should they?"</p>

<p>"You are pigheaded, Jim. What did I tell
you last night? This thing put its mark on
her, in a way no man has a right to mark a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
woman without her consent. See that trout
jump, in the pool down yonder? I must get
him."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. What I told you about
could not have been known unless the lady told
it; and she was not of that sort. I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Decidedly you don't. I can't waste a day
like this on second-hand gossip, Jim; as you
said yesterday, the evening is the time for talk.
You go home and change your clothes and rest
your brain. I know my way here, and I want
to fill my basket. I'll get back in time for
supper. Here, you can take these."</p>

<p>And so I sent him off. He is biddable and
humble now, and will be more so presently; in
a kind of transition state, he is. He came
back in the afternoon, and sat on the bank
while I pulled out the biggest fish yet. I
carried home the best basket we've had; not so
many specimens, but far finer ones, than from
that Devil's Brook in the Land Accursed.
In fishing, as in other things, a good deal depends
on your state of mind.</p>

<p>That evening I dressed for dinner, as far as I
could, like a gentleman; not that any visitors
were likely to drop in, but I thought it due to
the occasion. Jim, having plenty of leisure
at command, and noting my man&oelig;uvres, did
the same. He ate little, but I paid due attention
to the trout and claret, and took my time
to it; though we do not have a lot of courses
and ceremony at meals up here, nor are such
necessary. Then we settled ourselves in easy
chairs before the great fireplace, where pine
logs were roaring: the nights are cold now, and
this is one comfort of these out-of-the-way
places, where fuel is plenty.</p>

<p>As soon as he had a chance, he began.
"There is some mystery about this, Bob. You
wouldn't answer my question this morning."</p>

<p>"Now that I have dined, James, I'll answer
any questions you like&mdash;provided they are such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as may fitly be put to the father of a family.
So fire away."</p>

<p>"First then, how do you come to know so
much about this?"</p>

<p>"Because I was there. O, not eavesdropping,
not as a spy&mdash;that is out of my line; but purely,
and luckily as it proves, by accident." And
I told him all about it. I will not say that his
jaw dropped, but his facial apparatus elongated.</p>

<p>"Then Cl&mdash;she knows that you know?"</p>

<p>"Not a word. What do you take me for?
How could I tell her?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;the others know?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. You have the most extraordinary
notions, Hartman. It was her secret,
not theirs. If you had been in my place, perhaps
you would have written to the papers, or
told the story at family prayers. Can't you see
that it was impossible for me to let her know
till I had had it out with you?"</p>

<p>"And you have stood by me, knowing all
this&mdash;you are still my friend?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I had had merely myself to consider,
my natural loathing and contempt for the
beast, ape, idiot and scoundrel who was capable
of such conduct might have led me to extremities.
O, I endorse all the compliments you
have paid yourself. But there is my interesting
family; the twins have quite a regard for
you, and Herbert. And so has my wife; she
doesn't know you as well as I do. And my
sister&mdash;a superior person, though too soft-hearted,
whom I cherish with a deep fraternal
affection&mdash;she has been besieging me with intercessions,
and melting my obduracy with her
tears; and that for one who has made all this
coil, and whose qualities have been too well
enumerated by himself."</p>

<p>"I will try to be more deserving of her kindness,
Bob: I told you she was the right sort.
But you said just now they did not know."</p>

<p>"Only by surmise, and inference from your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hasty departure, and from&mdash;subsequent developments.
Women are not wholly fools, Jim:
they are just as good as we; perhaps better,
and sometimes wiser. O, they are very well in
their way. Let us bear with them, James, and
allow for their redeeming traits."</p>

<p>"Don't hit a man with his own words when
he is down, Bob. But&mdash;there is Another, whom
you've not mentioned."</p>

<p>"So there is: you didn't mention her, either.
Come to think of it, there is another member
of my household, whom we have overlooked in
this discussion, yet to whom I owe some sort of
consideration."</p>

<p>"Of course I know who is first with you: I
am content to come in a bad second. You
haven't&mdash;I suppose&mdash;any word&mdash;from Her?"</p>

<p>"What do you take her for? Ladies can't
do that sort of thing. See here, Hartman,
don't get on that line again. She is used to
due respect."</p>

<p>His face fell. "I know: I mean nothing
else. What have you to say to me then?"</p>

<p>"Say? Haven't I said enough? Confound
you, it's your turn to say things now."</p>

<p>"I thought I had said a good deal. O, I am
ready to make my submission, if it will do any
good. Imagine the rest, can't you? Don't be
playing your games on me now, Bob."</p>

<p>There was a tone of pathos in this: I took a
good look at him, and saw that he was doing
the contrite as well as I could expect. He will
do it better without a middleman when he gets
the chance; he'll hardly lapse into the other
style again soon. All I have to do is to secure
her position meanwhile.</p>

<p>"Well, what comes next? I believe I am on
the witness-stand now."</p>

<p>"Tell me about Her, Bob."</p>

<p>"She is changed. Of old, one never knew
what to expect of her. Now she is different.
No stale customs about her, my boy."</p>

<p>"'Nor custom stale her infinite variety,' I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
suppose you mean. Yes, so I found&mdash;but that
was my own fault. Some might prefer your
version. But you don't imply&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. You must find out for yourself
about that. I thought you knew that she
is chary of her confidences, and that none of us
is given to seeking them. She has mentioned
your name once in all this time, and then to
say that you and I were great clumsy things&mdash;which
is true; measurably of me, of you most
eminently."</p>

<p>"What chance is there for me then?" He
was discouraged again. Jim is so foolish; he
gets exalted and depressed on the slightest
provocation. Perhaps I was like that once,
but it was long ago.</p>

<p>"Well, she knows I am here; do you suppose
I would have come if she objected? Make
what you can out of that.&mdash;You needn't make
too much of it either: go slow, now. You see
she doesn't like to be thwarted in her benevolent
plans; and you were a wild man, to be
reclaimed and civilized. Instead of submitting
like a decent savage, you broke loose all at
once, and left her to feel that she had done
you harm instead of good. You are the only
fellow who ever gave her any trouble: I can't
see how you had the cheek to do it. Why,
man, you have got to learn manners if you
want to associate with that kind. She could
do better than you any day; but a wilful
woman must have her way, and a gentleman
usually lets her have it.&mdash;Now there you go
again. I didn't say what her way might be in
this case, did I? How should I know what she
wants of you? Probably just to smooth you
down, and be friends, and see you behave. The
other supposition, as you said last night, is too
wildly impossible. You ought to be glad to
meet her on any terms she may choose to make,
and thankful and proud to undergo any penance
of her imposing, after your conduct, and
the annoyance it has caused her and all of us.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Most women, in her place, would let you stay
in the woods and eat your heart out. Perhaps
she will yet; you needn't look so pleased. All
I know is that you owe her reparation. You
ought to go on your knees from here to the
avenue, even if you have to come back on foot."</p>

<p>"You have gained in insight since August,
Bob. You express my views with accuracy&mdash;though
one can hardly talk of these matters to
another man. I always honored you for holding
Her in such esteem. But practically, what
am I to do?"</p>

<p>"That is not easy to say, James: it can
hardly be plain sailing. If women were not
more forgiving than we, bless their little hearts,
you would have no chance to do anything.
And the finer grain they are of, the more embarrassing
it becomes; with her sort it is
peculiarly difficult. I know, from long and
trying experience; I have to mind my p's and
q's, I tell you. If you had taken up with one
of these farmers' daughters, as you nearly led
me to believe last night&mdash;there's nothing to
get mad about&mdash;it would have been much
simpler and easier for you. If it were that
other man, I should say to him, Write to the
lady, if you think that safe: I don't advise it.
But if you had a friend who knew her well,
and was a person of capacity and resource and
great tact and approved discretion, and willing
to employ all these qualities in your service&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, I'll leave the affair in your hands: I
don't see what else I can do. I'm everlastingly
obliged to you, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think you would be; a nice
mess you'd make of it by yourself. You have
no idea how this thing has weighed on my mind
ever since you left us at Newport; nor how
awkward it is, even for me, to approach a girl
of her sensitive pride and highminded delicacy
on such a subject. But I'm ready to go on
suffering in your cause, James, even if it be for
years."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
"I hope it won't take as long as that. Hurry
it up, old man, now you've got a start. Don't
let the injury to Her and the weight on my
conscience go on accumulating. What you do,
do quickly."</p>

<p>"So you'd like me to rush off <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'to-morow'">to-morrow</ins>?
There's gratitude. No, sir; I must think the
matter over, and I may have to consult you
about details. Besides, they are all exercised
about my health, and expect me to make my
week out. Your case is not a strong one,
James; all depends on the way it is put. I
will not ruin it by indecent pressure or undue
haste. Leave it to me, and let sweet sleep revisit
the weary head whence she has fled so
long. In simpler language, keep still and do as
I tell you, and don't bother."</p>

<p>I took pen and ink to my room, and indited
a home epistle. It informed Mabel that I was
progressing toward recovery, and expected to
ship some large trout, carefully packed in ice;
also that she was a true prophet, and the other
business in hand was moving just as she had
foretold. I enclosed a brief note to Clarice,
which said simply, "O. K. Ever thine," and
signed it with my initials and Jim's: and a
cartoon for Jane, which I sat up late to design
and execute. It represented a small lover,
transfixed with a large arrow, prostrating himself
before a Haughty Damsel of High Degree.
This work of art, with the subjoined effusions,
will keep up their spirits till I get home.</p>

<h3><a name="Wasted_Advice" id="Wasted_Advice"></a>XXX.</h3>

<h4>WASTED ADVICE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I will</span> not tell you what more we did that
week, nor how many wagonloads of big game
we bagged when we sallied forth with guns to
make war upon the monarchs of the forest:
perhaps their hides and horns are on view in
my library, and perhaps not. Nor will you
expect any more scenery of me, seeing how I
have groaned and sweated to produce the pen-pictures
you have already enjoyed: I don't
desire to advertise Jim's retreat too much, and
spoil its seclusion. He was impatient and
restive, but feeling much better than when I
came, and ready to do anything I wished&mdash;of
course. But he wanted to talk all the time,
and ask questions: he kept me busy pacifying
him, till I was tired. Rational conversation
on serious subjects is good, but to be thus
forever harping on small personal feelings and
relations makes one realize that Silence is
Golden. Clarice never acts in that way: I wish
Jim would have some occasional flashes of
taciturnity, like Macaulay.</p>

<p>The day before I left, while we were burying
a calf I had shot by mistake, he said, "Bob, do
you remember my asking you once, in a purely
suppositious way, what you would do if I were
to quarrel with&mdash;Her?"</p>

<p>"O yes. But the farmer that owned this
late lamented beast ought to be paid for it."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. I'll attend to it after
you're gone, and save your feelings. Well, you
said you'd stand by both of us."</p>

<p>"Hang my feelings: do you suppose I expend
feelings on a misguided heifer? It got in the
bushes where you said I might look for a deer,
and here's a ten on account; you can write me
if it costs more. My sympathies, James, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
reserved for nobler animals when they make
worse mistakes."</p>

<p>"Yes, as I have proved. You've kept your
word; but you were pretty rough on me."</p>

<p>"Your conduct was pretty rough on all of
us. I had to open your eyes; and I don't want
you to try those tricks again. If you do, I
may have to shoot you by mistake."</p>

<p>"You would have been welcome to shoot me
last week. Why did you leave me so long in
the dark, Bob?"</p>

<p>"O, the deuce! Were explanations due from
our side? It's true you need somebody to take
care of you; but, you see, I have others to look
after, and so can't devote myself exclusively to
you: you'd better get a keeper. It was Jane
who urged my coming up here. I always meant
to, but I couldn't till Clarice suggested it."</p>

<p>"She suggested it, did she? You never told
me that before."</p>

<p>"I ought not to have told you now, if it makes
you fly off the handle in this way. She merely
said to Mabel, no doubt in all sincerity, that I
looked badly and needed a change; she said
nothing about my coming here. She has a
regard for me; whether you are anybody in her
eyes remains to be seen. Don't jump to conclusions,
now. The Princess is not a person
to take liberties with, as I've learned by repeated
lessons."</p>

<p>"I know it, Bob: one lesson is enough for
me. I suppose it would hardly do for me to go
back with you?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. Personally I should be delighted,
and so would some others; but&mdash;you know as
well as I do. I have got to feel somebody's
pulse, and proceed very gingerly. Possess your
soul in what patience you can till you hear
from me. See here, Hartman; with your
views, and your well-grounded aversion to domestic
and even social life, a little of this sort
of thing ought to go a long way. I should
think you'd be unwilling to risk contact with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the world again. A child that will play about the
cars, you know, after it's once been run over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, but you have opened my eyes to a
sacred duty. Honor is above self-preservation.
I want to purge my conscience, you see."</p>

<p>"Then do that and pause there. It was your
vaulting ambition which overleaped all bounds
before. If you get into another row, you may
have to stay in it. I have full power of attorney,
you say; well, I may have to make all
sorts of promises for you before I can get you
leave to return to duty, and you'll be expected
to keep them. You don't know how difficult
that will be for your unbridled inexperience;
you'll be cabined, cribbed, confined within
the dull limits of Propriety. It would be much
better for you to be content with a correspondence,
if you can get as far as that. You could
expound your penitence and changed views by
mail, and have time to think what you were
saying, and get it in shape; whereas, if you
plunge into the cold and heartless world again,
you'll probably get into more trouble, and I
can't come up here to set you straight again&mdash;not
before next May. You were right, James:
there is nothing in common between you and
the world. Why expose yourself to its temptations,
its dangers, its hollow and soul-wearying
forms? This atmosphere is so much purer;
there is less of Vanity and Woe up here. Stay
where you are well off. Clarice can write a
pretty good letter when she chooses; I'll try to
fix it that way for you." But he would not
accept this reasonable view, and insisted on my
getting permission for him to come down before
Christmas, and as much sooner as possible.</p>

<p>So nobody but he could drive me to the cars;
he filled the fifteen miles with charges and
reminders. As the train moved off, he was
waving his hat, his face radiant with hope and
pathetic with confidence. He looks ten years
younger than he did last week. A pretty fellow
he is to call himself a Pessimist.</p>

<h3><a name="Results_Reported" id="Results_Reported"></a>XXXI.</h3>

<h4>RESULTS REPORTED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I reached</span> home in the early evening. The
servant told me at the door that Mrs. T. was
in attendance on Master Herbert, who had
fallen over the banisters and injured his nasal
organ. I rushed upstairs: Mabel met me with
no demonstrations of grief or anxiety. "I see
by your face that it is all right&mdash;as I always
said it would be. Go to Clarice; she is in the
library. O, Herbert? He fell on his nose, of
course; he always does. It is not at all serious.
The dear child has been feeling better since we
heard from you, and taking more exercise.
Clarice has the first right to your news."</p>

<p>I found her, and dropped on my knees.
She looked at me, not so sweetly as of late.
"Get up, Robert, I thought I had cured you of
your bad habit of untimely jesting."</p>

<p>"You have. I realize the solemnity of the
occasion, if you do not. My name is James&mdash;no,
that's not it. I am a representative, an envoy.
You see before you a banished man who
has justly incurred his sovereign's displeasure,
and has repented day and night. This posture,
perhaps unseemly in the father of a family,
expresses the other fellow's state of mind. He's
afraid to come himself, and so he sent me."</p>

<p>She looked at me again, and saw that I was
serious. You see, these delicate matters have
to be managed delicately. I can't do the unmitigated
tragedy business as well as Hartman
might, and yet I had to meet the requirements
of the situation, and the Princess' expectations,
which are always high. People who have their
own affairs of this kind to conduct might
sometimes avoid painful failures by taking a
leaf out of my book, and mixing the difficult
passages with a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;chastened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and judicious humor; then they would avoid
overdoing it, and sending the lady off disgusted.</p>

<p>"Does he take all the blame?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely: he did from the first moment.
He can't come here to say so till he's allowed,
and he can't get up till you give him a token
of forgiveness."</p>

<p>She gave it: it was inexpensive to her, and
soothing to the penitent&mdash;or would have been
if he had been there to get it in person. I
took it simply on his account.</p>

<p>"Keep still now, and let me think."</p>

<p>I kept still. The attitude of prayer, while
well suited to the lighter forms of ladies, is
inconvenient to a man of my size, and deeply
distressing when I am obliged to maintain it
for more than five minutes; for that reason I
don't go to church as much as I might. But I
had to keep quiet while she did her thinking.
May it be recorded to my credit! I would bear
a good deal for Clarice, and sometimes I have
to.</p>

<p>At last she finished her cogitations. "O,
get up, Robert; I forgot. What else have you
to tell me? But don't you want some supper?"</p>

<p>I was as hungry as a bison, but that was a
secondary consideration.</p>

<p>"The supper can wait while I have your
work to do. I'll tell you anything you care to
know: he wants to have no secrets from you.
But it has all been graphically summed up
already. A famous orator of old told a young
fellow who went to him to learn how to speak
a piece, 'Act it.' That's what I've been
doing the last half hour: I didn't think it
would take so long."</p>

<p>I rubbed my knees, which were still sore:
the library carpet is reasonably thick, but it
was not built for devotional uses, "I suppose
Hartman would be glad to stay down there all
night if he had the chance. But he'd be awkward
about it&mdash;infernally awkward. You see,
he has had no practice in this kind of thing;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
he doesn't know your ways as I do. I wonder
if you will ever get him into as good training
as you have me."</p>

<p>I put in this light badinage to relieve any
embarrassment she might feel&mdash;not that she
could show any such if she tried, but for what
you and I know even she might feel it&mdash;and to
let her get used to the situation. But she did
not seem to care for it. "That's enough for
now, Robert. Go and get your supper." She
said this in a weary tone. My heart sank.</p>

<p>"Princess dear, have I offended you? I
meant it all right. Have I done anything
wrong, and made a mess of this as usual?"</p>

<p>She gave me her hand. "O no, Bob. But
go now. I'll talk more to you to-morrow."</p>

<p>Now I thought I had done this up in the
most superior style, and that she would be
pleased for once. But the ways of women are
past man's understanding.</p>

<p>Jane awaited me in the dining-room with
viands and an anxious brow, and would scarcely
let me appease the cravings of exhausted nature.
She sent the servant out, and ministered
to my wants herself.</p>

<p>"Brother, you look downcast. Have you
returned with empty hands?"</p>

<p>"I have brought some of the finest trout you
ever saw&mdash;not in mere size perhaps, but in flavor,
colors, and gaminess. You didn't expect me to
carry 'em on a string over my shoulder, did you?
And I would have brought some venison, but you
don't care for it. You told me once that their
eyes were so pretty and plaintive, it was a
shame to kill them. I always try to please you,
so I thought I would let them live.&mdash;Yes,
thank you, I have brought back more health
than I took away: I may be able now to stand
the fatigues of business till Thanksgiving.&mdash;O,
Hartman? I couldn't bring him along, you
know: where is your sense of propriety? I
advised him to stay up there where he is safe,
and not tempt the shafts and arrows any more.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
What, I 'haven't done anything then, after
all?' O, haven't I! Jane, you are worse than
a serpent's tooth: if Lear had been in my
place, he would have talked about a thankless
sister. It has been a weary, toilsome, painful
task, and few men could have carried it through
to so happy an end. And when I come back
hungering for sympathy&mdash;I told you what my
nature was&mdash;you meet me with cold words and
suspicious looks. It is enough to make one
weep, and long for the silent grave. If it were
Hartman, you would do the weeping, no doubt.
Yet that man, whom you thus unnaturally set
above your brother&mdash;you have no idea of his
harshness, his violence, his embittered prejudice
and obstinacy; nor of the patience and gentleness
and persuasive force with which I expelled
the demons that possessed him, and brought
him to his right mind. O, he has had an
overhauling; he will take care how he does it
again. But he is all right now."</p>

<p>"I wonder at that, after his being in your
hands for a week. Your tender mercies were
cruel, I fear. What does Clarice say to this?
Is she satisfied?"</p>

<p>"She ought to be, but she says nothing at
all; couldn't take in the magnitude of my news
at once, most likely. Yet I took pains to break
it to her delicately, and with light touches of
humor, to relieve any strain there might
be."</p>

<p>"Yes, soothed her nerves as with a nutmeg-grater,
no doubt. You will serenade her next
with tin pans and fish-horns, and think that a
delicate attention. Brother, Clarice does not
share your peculiar view of humor, nor do I.
Mabel tries to comprehend it and to catch your
tone, as is her melancholy duty; but it is hard
work for her. Well, what does Mr. Hartman
say?&mdash;Don't tell me anything that is private,
or belongs to Clarice alone."</p>

<p>"O, you may hear most of it. He says all
sorts of things&mdash;anything you like. You see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
he can't be trusted, or trust himself, any
longer, so I have full power to represent him."</p>

<p>"That is definite, and convenient for you,
whatever it may be to others. Of course a man
will promise anything when he has an object
to gain. I suppose you left him in the depths
of despair and on a pinnacle of ecstasy at
once."</p>

<p>"That is about it. Let us be thankful that
you and I <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: there is no 'are' in the original">are</ins> well beyond these follies.&mdash;My dear,
I wasn't alluding to your age; upon my honor
I wasn't. I only meant that your elevation of
mind and dignity of character lift you far above
such idiotic transports, and give you a right to
despise weak creatures like Jim, and in some
degree even myself. No man is worthy of you,
Jane: you know you never would look at any
of them. What did I tell you about your
looks? Except Clarice, and perhaps I ought
to say Mabel, and a few on the cars, you are by
far the handsomest woman I've seen since I
left home."</p>

<p>"After your week among the belles of Wayback,
that compliment seems strained. O, I
see: Clarice was not in the right mood just
now, and your tide of geniality rolled back
upon itself, so that it has to break loose on
some one else: or you are to see her again to-morrow,
and must practice smooth things
meantime to say then.&mdash;Ah, it is both, is it?"</p>

<p>"Sister, you are an external conscience&mdash;except
that you won't approve when I have done
the right thing, and done it well. You would
be invaluable to Jim. I doubt whether he and
Clarice will get on; and he thinks a heap of
you. If he don't suit her on further inspection,
or makes any more blunders, you might
take him in hand and make a man of him."</p>

<p>"So as to keep him in reach as material for
you? Robert, if you want me to comfort you
when Clarice is gone, you will have to make
your light humor much lighter yet, and let me
select subjects for its exercise."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"Now, now&mdash;do you think I would offer you
secondhand goods? If I had known him then
as I do to-day, I would have let her go off in
June as she proposed, and fixed it the other
way. It would have saved no end of bother."</p>

<p>"And deprived you of a source of huge
amusement, and an <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'unprecendented'">unprecedented</ins> field for
the display of your peculiar talents. Do you
think men and women are mere puppets for
you to play with? You would make but a poor
tenth-rate Providence&mdash;though you may have
succeeded in this case. Tell me how you did
it."</p>

<p>"I showed him that he was all wrong. He
knew that already, but thought she didn't care.
I told him she did."</p>

<p>"Robert! You have not betrayed her? Is this
your diplomacy?"</p>

<p>"Of course not: how you talk, Jane. I said
her interest in him was philanthropic, and he
had behaved with brutal ingratitude&mdash;like a
charity patient in the hospital, or a bad boy at
Sunday School; so he ought to yearn to come
back&mdash;if she will kindly allow&mdash;and give her a
chance to go on reforming him or not, just as
she pleases. I admitted the purely speculative
possibility that it might be otherwise&mdash;of a
more personal and commonplace description&mdash;just
to encourage him a little; but as he had
said at the start that this chance was practically
nonexistent, I let him think so and dwelt on
the other view, which was new to him, and
impressive. O, I preserved her dignity; that
was the first necessity. If he is cherishing any
hopes of the vulgar, everyday sort, he did not
get them from me."</p>

<p>"And did he believe all that? If so, I must
have been mistaken in the man."</p>

<p>"He had to believe it. It was the simple
truth: I merely arranged the colors properly
on his mental canvas. He thinks I am Solon
and Rhadamanthus and Nehemiah in one.
How would you have done it perhaps, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
you had to hook your fish without letting him
get the bait&mdash;induce him to commit himself,
and yet not commit her at all?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, brother. You could not
have thrown her on his generosity, of course;
she would have killed herself and him and all
of us, rather than take happiness at such a
price&mdash;and I can't blame her. Yet she despises
a subterfuge. I would not tell her the
details if I were you; she will not ask for them,
nor want to hear them. It is a queer world:
when such things have to be done&mdash;sacrificing
your best friend to insure his welfare, deceiving
him in the interest of one who abhors deception&mdash;your
eccentricities may be of more use than
I had hitherto supposed possible."</p>

<p>I pretended to be deeply pained at this; but
in my heart I knew it was high praise, coming
from Jane. She is not like Clarice; she asked
all manner of questions, and kept me answering
them three mortal hours. Fortunately Mabel
has less curiosity, or I should not have got much
sleep that night, after all my ill-appreciated
labors. But I don't regret what I did for
Hartman; <i>he</i> believes what you tell him.</p>

<h3><a name="Confession" id="Confession"></a>XXXII.</h3>

<h4>CONFESSION.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Clarice</span> was not at breakfast next day; but
as I was going out, she met me in the hall.
"Robert, can you come back at four?"</p>

<p>"At any hour you wish, Princess; or I will
stay now."</p>

<p>"No, that will be early enough. I will be
in the library."</p>

<p>Now that is Clarice all over: she is herself
again. No eagerness, no petty curiosity, but a
grand indifference, a statuesque calm, a goddess-like
withdrawal from the affairs and atmosphere
of common mortals. Indeed it is not she who
will ask for details that any other woman would
burn to know: a single question as to the vital
point, and then "what else have you to tell
me?" The rest might keep a day, a week, a
month. Her taste was always for large outlines,
her mind has breadth and grasp and
comprehension; when she seemed to care for
little things, she was at play. In a matter like
this, her secret thoughts are the main element;
what others may think or say or do need be
noticed only as contributing material for them
to work with. What has vexed her all this
time has been that the sacrilege of events had
put one factor in the problem out of reach,
beyond her control: she has been used to having
all she wanted of the earth, and deigning to
want but little of it and to value that little but
lightly. Now that she cares for something at
last, and it is at her call again, she will weigh
and <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'meusure'">measure</ins> the situation, and all its aspects
and possibilities, in the silent council chamber
of her soul, and the decision will go forth before
any one ventures to ask what it may be. Stay
in your cave, hermit of Wayback, and say your
<i>Ave Clarissa</i> as patiently as you can: when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
edict calls you to court, your part will be cast
for you, and you will have nothing to do but
say the lines. If you break bounds again and
stray from your proper posture before the throne,
or put in any more of your irreverent gags, I
am done with you.</p>

<p>I have wrought your will, my Princess, and
brought back your pretty toy, for you to mend
or break: you hardly mean to break it. Yet
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'is'">it</ins> is a pity to see you descend to common uses,
to ordering a house and taking care of poor old
Jim; you were born to shine apart in solitary
state, and have men gaze at you wistfully from
far below. No man can rate more highly than
I the domestic relations, affections, virtues; but
I don't like to see you put yourself in the category
of mere human beings, as if marriage and
a man were good enough for you. You will
have your way, now as always, and use me at
your will: it is you who have the ordering of
this funeral, not I.</p>

<p>As she did not seem to like my style last
night, I had better be sober and plain this
afternoon; sort of Quaker thee and thou, without
artistic embellishments. Yes, by Jove, I'll
have to be, for there's the guilty secret to be
unloaded. There <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'is is'">is</ins> no excuse for keeping
it to myself any longer, now Jim has it; sooner
or later she must know that I've known all along
what was not meant for me, and it may as well
be done now, whatever the result. It will not
please her, but I can't help that. I will not
break my word and keep a thing from her,
except as there is reason; to tell it can do no
great harm now, unless to me&mdash;and that is a
minor matter.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed I was on deck: no
one ever interrupts the Princess, and we were
undisturbed. "Robert, I had better hear your
report. Cut it short, please; give me a condensed
outline merely."</p>

<p>What did I tell you? This was said with an
air as if she were discharging an unwelcome
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
duty, so that I might not feel neglected. She
evidently resents the impertinence of circumstances
in forcing her to allow me to have a
hand in her private matters: it will be as much
as I can expect if she forgives me for meddling.
Obeying orders, I endeavored to be brief and
business-like.</p>

<p>"He has had a bad time of it, Clarice. He
was a changed man when I got there&mdash;rough
and morose and unmanageable; kept hinting
at some mysterious crime he had committed.
It was a day or two before I could bring him to
book, by methods on which I need not dwell.
Detective work is not a nice business; the
means has to take its justification from the end.
He made his confession as if it were another's;
said how superior you were, and how basely he
had repaid your condescension. He thought
that ended the affair, except for his lifelong
remorse; hoped he might die soon; impossible
to be forgiven, or regarded by you in any light
but that of a loathsome object&mdash;regular stage
part, you know, but perfectly sincere: if you
like innocence, he can supply a first-class article.
I put a head on him by saying his behavior
had been much more flagrant than he
realized, and the worst part of it was interfering
with your plans and going off in such a
hurry; that ladies like to be consulted in such
cases, and sometimes to administer divine forgiveness,
or at least punish the transgressor in
their own way, and not leave it all to him.&mdash;You
need not look at me like that, Princess.
I know nothing of your feelings, and told him
so. Of course I maintained your dignity: what
else was I there for? And so, to do him
justice, did he, as far as he knows how. He is
just where you like to have them&mdash;or would if
you cared enough about them. After I had
enlightened him as to his duty, it was all
simple. I gave him just sufficient hope&mdash;of
pardon, I mean&mdash;to keep him alive, and turn
his despair to active penitence. The game is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
entirely in your hands now. He was on fire
to come back with me, or to write at once. I
said he must take no more liberties, but wait for
permission. If I may venture a suggestion,
you might let me tell him to write you; then
you can graciously allow him to come when
you are ready for him."</p>

<p>That I may call a succinct and lucid narrative.
She listened to it with clear eyes like
Portia, as if she were a judge and had to hear
such cases every day. Now for questions: I
bet odds there will not be more than three, and
those straight to the heart of my discourse&mdash;nothing
irrelevant, or secondary, or sentimental.</p>

<p>"Did he say what had been his offence?"</p>

<p>"Presumption. He insulted you&mdash;though
of course he didn't mean to&mdash;and you very
properly resented it and withered him with
contempt. He never understood, till I made
him see it, that what he did next was worse
than this, as emphasizing the wrong and making
it&mdash;for a while&mdash;irrevocable."</p>

<p>Her eyes were like judgment lightnings now,
that might burn through the darkness and
bring out all hidden things. Luckily I had
nothing to hide; or rather I was about to make
a clean breast of it.</p>

<p>"How were you able to speak so positively?"</p>

<p>"That is what he asked me, and therein lay
such power as I had to master him; at least it
was the chief weapon in my arsenal. I answer
you as I answered him: By knowing more
about the matter than he did. Princess, I
have deceived you all along, and broken my
promise to tell you everything. I saw and
overheard the quarrel." And then I told her
all about it.</p>

<p>She looked at me silently, with an expression
I never saw before. I turned away, as one
turns from the sun in his strength. I was sitting
on a stool beside her, and I suppose my
head went down. Suddenly a hand was on my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
forehead, pushing it back. "Robert, look
at me. What was your motive in keeping this
from me?"</p>

<p>"O, the motives were mixed; they always
are. There was my dread of offending you;
that was selfish. And more than that, I did
not want to hurt you, if it could be avoided.
And most, I was not willing to complicate the
trouble, and all but certainly make it worse.
It seemed to me that you would be shocked,
and disgusted, and enraged to know that a
third person had intruded on so private a scene,
and surprised a secret that belonged to you.
Don't fancy that I was blaming you; that was
my rough guess at how any woman would feel,
most of all you: perhaps I was wrong. I
thought that for you to know might widen
the breach, and destroy all chance of reconciliation.
I had to think of him, as well as of
you. Not as well, no; not as much&mdash;you know
that; but of him too. I could not tell you till
I had told him, and made the matter right&mdash;if
you will have it so. You will not let it turn
you against him now&mdash;this fact that I was
there? It was not his fault: it was an accident,
and I am the only one to blame. I
did the best I could, after such lights as I
had."</p>

<p>Still the great eyes kept burning into mine;
but they did not hurt so much as I had expected.
"Did you tell Mabel and Jane of
this?"</p>

<p>"How could I? It was your secret. What
do you take me for, Clarice? I never breathed
a word of it, of course, until I had it out with
Jim a week ago, and brought him to his senses:
after that I thought you ought to know.
Mabel and Jane never dreamed that I knew
anything beyond what little you might have
told me, or let me see."</p>

<p>Her arms were round my neck now. There
was a minute or two of silence: I really did not
know what to say next. Then she looked up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
tears in her eyes, a tone I never could describe
in her voice.</p>

<p>"And you have done all this for me, Robert!"</p>

<p>I made a feeble attempt to unloose her hands
and draw myself up. "Don't talk that way,
Clarice; it hurts me. You make too much of
this; it was a matter of course, and there is
nothing new in it. I thought you knew I was
always ready to do anything I could for you:
that is an old story, as you used to say."</p>

<p>The effort at dignity was not successful, for
her head drooped again. Soon she raised it, a
smile chasing the tears away.</p>

<p>"You can triumph over Jane now. She
used to say you never could keep a secret. Did
you enjoy keeping this one, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I will keep some more if you
insist on it, but it would be more enjoyable if
they were of another sort. No more like this,
if it is the same to you."</p>

<p>"You said you used this as a weapon to
master him with. Why didn't you use it on
me? It might have been good for me to be
mastered and overruled."</p>

<p>I had to laugh now. "Jim can try that by
and by&mdash;if he dares. Other men may overrule
other women, perhaps; I know my place too
well. Clarice, it is not like you to talk nonsense.
If I could have consulted you about
this&mdash;how to keep the secret, and what to do
with it&mdash;it would have made things easier for
me, but unhappily that was not feasible. You
don't mean it would have done good instead of
harm if I had told you earlier?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it. No, you were right. Brother,
there is so much more of you than any of us
thought!"</p>

<p>"So Hartman has found. But I don't want
to be unduly exalted. Love is better than
pride, and this trouble of yours has brought us
all closer together, I believe. There is only
one thing to be done yet."</p>

<p>"No; two at least. Robert, you deserve to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
know everything. I will tell you what we
were talking about that wretched day, so that
you may see what excuse there was for him,
and how wrong I was. And then you can tell
Jane and Mabel."</p>

<p>"I don't want to know, my dear, nor is there
any need to tell them anything. None of us
desire to pry into your affairs, but only to see
them set right. It was plain <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'that that'">that</ins> something
led up to poor Jim's blunder, and that is
enough. You can tell Mabel and Jane what
you like before he comes back,&mdash;though they
won't ask it.&mdash;I will overrule you for once, as
you insist. You want to put a force upon
yourself for my sake, and I will not have it;
not another word of that. But&mdash;and in this
case I am not overruling, but only suggesting&mdash;Jim
is waiting all this time. May I tell him
that he can write to you?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet. You have opened my eyes as
well as his, Bob; <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: you're">you've</ins> revealed so many
masculine virtues that I must take them in by
degrees. You've been keeping yourself in the
background and putting him forward, as if I
could be interested in one person only. Now
let him wait a day or two, while I think about
you."</p>

<p>There may have been more of these exchanges,
which I do not care to repeat. What
goes on in the domestic circle is essentially of
a private nature, too intimate and sacred to be
whispered into the general ear. There are
persons who will violate these holy confidences,
and tell you what he said and she said when
the doors were shut. I am not like them. If
I appear at times to break my own rule and
treat you as a member of the household, it is
merely for your improvement, that you may
see (as I told Jim last summer) how things are
arranged in a christian family: and especially
that, when any trouble of this kind invades
your own humble roof, you may know how to
slay the lion and extract strength and sweetness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
from his carcass, as I have done. Should these
pages instruct but a single brother, whether by
nature or adoption, how to unwind his sister's
tangled affairs and bring them to a prosperous
conclusion, I shall not have penned them in
vain.</p>

<h3><a name="A_Family_Conclave" id="A_Family_Conclave"></a>XXXIII.</h3>

<h4>A FAMILY CONCLAVE.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> written to Hartman more than once
since my return, telling him to keep up his
spirits and bide his time. Before long came
the permission to open a correspondence with a
more important person than I. What he
wrote I know not; he is probably able to do
that well enough, whatever blunders he may
commit when face to face. I have reason to
believe his outpouring was answered, with excessive
brevity but to the purpose, in the one
word, 'Come.' In fact, the Princess declined
(and very properly) to expend a postage-stamp
on him, or to gratify him with an envelope of
her own inditing, but told me to enclose this
minute but inflammatory document in non-explosive
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wrapings'">wrappings</ins> of my own.</p>

<p>He was to arrive on a certain day in late
November. The evening previous, as we were
sitting together, Clarice&mdash;who generally prefers
her own society, and I can't blame her&mdash;appeared,
in our midst (if that expression is allowable),
with an aspect of grim determination.
I rose to give her a chair in the corner, but she
sat down where she could see us and we could
look at her. We did so, anxiously expectant,
for this was a most unusual proceeding; and I
inwardly resolved to make it easier for her than
she meant to have it. She began with the air
of an orator who reluctantly emerges from seclusion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
at his country's call, constrained to
deliver matter of pith and moment.</p>

<p>"It is no news that you all have shown me
kindness such as passes all acknowledgment&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was not allowed to proceed without
hindrance. Jane put forth an interrupting
hand, which the speaker seized and imprisoned
in her own: not that Clarice's is bigger than
Jane's, but it possesses some muscular force.
Mabel opened her lips, and one of us&mdash;I will
not say which&mdash;was obliged to remind her that
Miss Elliston had the floor.</p>

<p>"It is not in me to be demonstrative, and I
have seemed cold and thankless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We knew you better than that, dear," came
from both.</p>

<p>"&mdash;But I knew, I felt it all. Never did a
girl without natural protectors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you can have a natural protector whenever
you like," cried Mabel. "You might
have had any number of them, for years past."</p>

<p>"Well, with or without, no girl ever had, or
could have had, more faithful affection and
delicate <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'consideraton'">consideration</ins> shown her than I. I have
given you a great deal of trouble, and you never
complained. I have come between you and
friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear," Mabel interposed again, "that is
all right. Our friends will come back." And
she nodded and looked like a female Solomon,
while Jane whispered something and put her
disengaged arm around the orator.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me any more, please. You
know it is not easy for me to talk of these
matters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is so," said I. "It is rarely we get
a speech from Clarice on any subject. Do keep
quiet, all of you, and let the poor girl go
on."</p>

<p>"But now I must tell you something you
have no idea of."</p>

<p>Here the female portion of the audience
pricked up their ears, and I began to be nervous.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
"It is about Mr. Hartman's going away
in August. That was all my fault."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe her," said I. "He says
it was all his fault."</p>

<p>"Do be quiet, Robert. He is coming to-morrow,
and justice must be done him. I
treated him very badly, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She didn't," said I. "Clarice, we don't
want to be dragged into all your private squabbles,
but if you will tell this disreputable story
you have got to tell it straight. Jim says you
merely showed a proper spirit, and so you did."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you know about it, Robert?"
cried Mabel and Jane together.</p>

<p>"He was there, hidden in the bushes, like
a villain in a cloak and slouched hat."</p>

<p>Here came a chorus of exclamations and reproaches,
till one of us had to say, "You may
as well give it up, Clarice. These women will
never let you go on; they don't know how to
listen. If you were talking only to me, now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jane, you can never twit him again with
not being able to keep a secret; he kept this
one sacredly for three months."</p>

<p>"Of course he did," said Mabel: "I always
knew it."</p>

<p>"Why, Robert, you told me&mdash;," Clarice
exclaimed, and "O no, you didn't, my dear,"
some one else put in, while Jane looked triumphant.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know this secret, of course,"
Mabel admitted: "I only meant that I always
knew Robert could keep a secret, if it were of
very extraordinary importance, and if he were
certain it would ruin everything to let it out.
Poor Robert, what a hard time you have had!"</p>

<p>"But how did he come to overhear your conversation?"
said Jane. "What business had
he there?"</p>

<p>"It was all through his pipe. Mabel, you
must never object to his pipe again."</p>

<p>"There now, Mabel," remarked another of
the company, "you wouldn't believe that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pipe was good for my health, and now you see
it has preserved the whole family."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," said the troublesome
Jane: "what was the use of your being there
intermeddling?"</p>

<p>"Jane," said one severely, "if you will be
still, you will probably learn. How can you
expect to hear anything when you keep on
interrupting Clarice like this?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to that now, Jane. What he
thus saw and heard he most patiently, and
heroically, and from the noblest motives&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, ladies," said I. "My pipe is
not handy, but I must go out and smoke a
cigar. I want to see a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the man smoke the cigar, and that
will provide for both of them. You will sit
down, Robert, and hear me out; I am not to
be overruled this time."</p>

<p>"It would give me the greatest pleasure to
hear you out, my dear, but you know your
health is delicate, and you are not accustomed
to public speaking. This is the longest oration
you ever made: Jane's constant interruptions
are trying, and you must be fatigued. If I
were you, I would rest now, and finish this up
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Now isn't that exactly like him?" cried
the irrepressible Jane. "He is afraid of your
exposures, as well he may be. Go on, Clarice,
and tell us what other iniquities he has committed,
besides deceiving Mabel and me about
this, while he was questioning us all the time,
and pretending to impart all he knew."</p>

<p>"He deceived me too. Yes, you may well
stare; he kept this absolutely to himself, till
he could use it for his own deep purposes; and"&mdash;she
blushed a little&mdash;"that is why things
are as they are."</p>

<p>I saw she wanted to be helped out, so I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the cause of this thusness.
You see, Mabel, what great results may spring
from a little pipe. Jane, you will have to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
admit that I am the guardian angel and protecting
genius of you all."</p>

<p>"Well, Clarice," said Jane, "I will own
that my estimate of his talents has risen lately;
but then my confidence in his moral character
has fallen in the same degree. He does tell
such dreadful falsehoods."</p>

<p>"It is not quite as if he told them for love of
them, simply for the pleasure he takes in falsehood
itself. You must allow for his motives."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mabel, "his motives are always
excellent, whatever his words and actions may
be. You remember the man in the Bible, who
was delivered to Satan for his soul's sake; and
I have heard Robert himself say that in ascending
a mountain you often have to go down
hill."</p>

<p>"She means," I explained, "that on the rare
occasions when I employ fiction, I do it purely
in the interests of Truth. That goddess is
imperfectly provided with garments&mdash;excuse
me for stating so scandalous a fact, but it is so.
Now this might have been well enough in
Eden before the fall, but it will not do now;
so we have to make the poor creature presentable,
and pay her milliner's bills, which are
often high. It would have been far more
congenial to my candid nature to tell you all at
once what I saw and heard that day in August;
but such a course might have been attended
with unpleasant consequences. If you will all
forgive me, I will try not to do it again."</p>

<p>"I do not see my way to forgive you, brother,"
said Jane with a judicial air, "unless Clarice
does; and that appears doubtful. I will be
guided entirely by her."</p>

<p>"I have managed my own affairs so well
without help, that you will naturally all wish
to be guided by me. It is a good deal for me
to do; but since Robert's misconduct has done
no great harm, and rather than come between
brother and sister, I will&mdash;yes, I will forgive
him." She rose majestically, signed to me to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
do the same, and gave me both hands, with
the air of a sovereign conferring knighthood;
we made an impressive tableau. "And since
you are all so quiet at last, I may finish my
speech, and state the reason for this act of leniency.
As Mr. Hartman's conversion is to be
completed this time without fail, it is plainly
necessary that he should find us a united
family."</p>

<hr style='width: 65%;' />

<h3><a name="To_Persons_About_to_Marry" id="To_Persons_About_to_Marry"></a>XXXIV.</h3>

<h4>TO PERSONS ABOUT TO MARRY.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">I would</span> have liked to celebrate Jim's arrival
by sundry pleasant and appropriate remarks;
but impressive warnings and entreaties had
reached me privately from three distinct quarters,
urging me to efface myself on this occasion,
and keep in the background. I complied
with these suggestions, and there were no
tumultuous rejoicings over the returning prodigal.
Mabel and Jane greeted him with unobtrusive
warmth: Clarice was rather stately
and very calm; to look at her, you would have
thought this was an ordinary call. When they
talk about my duplicity, they mean that they
want a monopoly of the article themselves.
The visitor flushed and trembled like a boy,
till I felt sorry for him, and would have offered
him something to drink if they had given me a
chance. Women are so queer about such matters:
instead of letting the poor man go off
with me, they pretended not to notice his confusion,
and talked about the weather and
mountains and trout, as if he wanted to discuss
such frivolities. This soon got to be a bore,
and I went to the new smoking-room, inviting
him to follow when he needed rational conversation.
He did not come at all, and I found
afterwards that my wife and sister had gone
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
away presently, and left him alone with Clarice&mdash;and
they such sticklers for Propriety.</p>

<p>I expected to have some fun watching this
tender pair; but I was disappointed. There
never is anything sensational to see when the
Princess is in action: she carries an atmosphere
of quietness about with her, and imposes it on
those who come within her circle. Hartman
broke rules and bounds once last summer, but
he seems unlikely to do it again. The rest of
us kept out of the way as much we could, and
gave them scope. I said to Jane that we
ought to get up a torchlight procession, or a
big dinner, or something, in Jim's honor, but
she scornfully told me to wait at least till the
engagement was announced. When he was
with me&mdash;which was little, for his time seemed
to be much occupied, and his weakness for
tobacco nearly cured&mdash;he once or twice attempted
some drivel about disinterested friendship
and undying gratitude; but I stopped
that. If there be one thing for which I profess
no sympathy, it is puling sentiment. He apparently
did not care to discuss the progress of
his affair, which was a relief; it is a dreadful
nuisance to have to listen to lovers' talk, and I
had enough of that at Wayback, when I could
not help myself. At our time of life a man
ought to be occupied with serious pursuits.
But Jim is as if he had been asleep in a cave
for ten years, and waked up with his beard
well grown and a large stock of emotional
aptitudes abnormally developed. I suppose
Clarice likes this kind of thing, but I wonder
at her taste.</p>

<p>They had been at it a week or so when I
stumbled upon them unawares one day in the
library. I tried to retreat, but they both called
to me to stop.</p>

<p>"Robert," said she, "we have quarrelled
again. That is, he has."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bob," said Jim, "and you'll have to
straighten it out for us as you did before."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
"This is too much," said I. "You had
better take the next train for home, and by
next May my health will need another change
and I'll come up and attend to your case."</p>

<p>"This needs to be settled right away. Clarice
wants to go to the woods and live there the
year round, and I can't permit such a sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Robert, he wants to live in the world like
other people, just for my sake, and I can't
permit such a sacrifice either."</p>

<p>"You must both prepare to be sacrificed, my
lambs. Each of you will have to bear and
forbear, and get used to the other's repulsive
selfishness and hidebound eccentricities, to
forego the sweet privacy and freedom of self-indulgence
which have marked your innocent
lives hitherto. When the glamour of young
romance has faded, when the bloom is rubbed
off the peach and the juice is crushed out of
the strawberry, there will remain only the hard
reality of daily duty, which is continual self-immolation.
You are wise to commence practising
this virtue at once."</p>

<p>"You must instruct us how to do it, Bob.
It would be as you say, no doubt&mdash;with her&mdash;if
she had to live at Wayback as she proposes.
You have been there enough to know that it is
no place for her; tell her so. She has confidence
in you, and she won't believe me."</p>

<p>"It would be as you say, Robert&mdash;with him&mdash;if
he had to live among the constraints and
shams which his soul abhors. You know it,
and you have great influence over him. Tell
him so."</p>

<p>"You are both right, and it is clear there is
no place where you can live&mdash;together. James,
she is a fragile flower; transplanted to your
sterile soil, she would soon wither and drop
from the stalk. Clarice, he is fastidious, critical,
and intense; made a part of the things he
despises, the torturing contact with pomps and
vanities would soon strike his knell. My little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
dears, your paths were never meant to unite,
and the best thing you can do is to part in
peace. James, this is all imagination, and you
know it; a milliner's lay-figure, or that rural
nymph at Wayback, would do just as well, and
be much less exacting and expensive. Clarice,
you are pushing <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'philantrophy'">philanthropy</ins> too far: the
picturesqueness of this hermit, and his alleged
romantic woes, have misled you as to the nature
of your interest in him. I don't think
<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'motrimony'">matrimony</ins> would suit you at all: you had
much better stay with us, whom you can leave
whenever you please. You could not do that
so easily with a husband, and you don't like
divorce. My children, pause: you will soon
have had enough of each other, and then you
can go your several ways in peace."</p>

<p>"See here, old man; it is too late for this
kind of wisdom, after all the pains you have
taken to bring us together when we were parted
indeed. You ought to be proud of your work,
and ready to give us your blessing."</p>

<p>"Don't mind Robert, James. You must
take him as you find him, and it encourages
him to go on if you seem to pay attention. All
you need is to give him time&mdash;generally a great
deal of it, to be sure. When you have known
him twenty years or so as I have, you will
understand that he usually has some tolerably
good sense at the bottom of his mind, underneath
a mountain of foolishness; he would say
it is like the beer after he has blown the froth
off.&mdash;Get to the sense as soon as you can, dear,
for we can't well wait more than a month or
two for it: we have to make our plans."</p>

<p>"I was going to say that you had better leave
the engagement unlimited as to time and say
nothing about it, for then you can get tired of
one another at leisure, and part without embarrassment.
But if you are in such indecent
haste, and seriously bent on ruin, I will assist
you over the precipice as gently as may be.
You will have to compromise, and humor each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
other a little. Go abroad for awhile, or to
Florida or the Pacific, till you feel less exclusive;
then come back to us. The house is big
enough, and you can make your winter home
here: we can't let you have her <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'an'">on</ins> any other
terms, Jim. You can enlarge your place when
the weather opens, and put in the spring and
fall there: some of us will come up, or I will
anyway, after trout. Perhaps I'll bring Jane:
she wanted to catch some. It would not be
safe for Herbert; he is too fond of bears. If
you find the whole summer there too much
bliss, as you will, you can divide with us at
Newport. That is fair to all parties, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It will do nicely, for a rough sketch at
least, and give us time to think. But there is
a more serious difficulty, as you will see. Robert,
he wants to give up his well-considered
principles of so many years, and just for me&mdash;however
he may deny it. Now I say he was
mainly right. Take Life in the large view,
and it is not a grand or beautiful thing. Have
we any right to overlook the misery of millions,
because a few of us like each other and are
outwardly comfortable? I will not have him do
so weak a thing as change his standards from
no better reason than&mdash;well, that you went up
to him for the fall fishing."</p>

<p>"My dear Clarice, if you set up as a Pessimist
apostle, you will convert all the town, and that
will never do.&mdash;You hear her, Jim? A wise
man sometimes has to take his sentiments from
a wiser woman. But seriously, I am ashamed
of you. Having used your eyes and brains
long ago and received a true impression, what
right have you to cast it away, and be misled
by a narrow prejudice in behalf of Life&mdash;or of
some particular section of it? If he that loves
a coral cheek and a ruby lip is but a redhot
donkey, what shall we say of him who makes
these his <ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'weatherguage'">weathergauge</ins> to test the universe
by?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"Well, Bob, perhaps I have received a new
impression, which is truer than the other&mdash;and
deeper. As you told me last summer, a world
with Clarice in it is quite different from a
world without her. Princess&mdash;if I may use his
term&mdash;Bob thinks a good deal of you too; at
least he used to. You entered into his scheme
of things as well as mine. Such is his duplicity,
perhaps you never suspected the fact."</p>

<p>"That is strange, when he has taken such
pains to get me off his hands. I could hardly
believe it of you, Robert, on any less authority;
it was an unworthy weakness, in such a philosopher.
But really now, are you going to
uphold him in this&mdash;against me?"</p>

<p>"Far from it: you will make him think
what you please&mdash;only your own opinion on
this point, though so strongly held and stated,
is somewhat recent. Let us have a middle
ground to start from, on which all parties can
meet, as in the other case. When things go
to suit us, let us call it a good world: when
they don't, of course it is a bad one. O, we can
consider the suffering millions too; but then
we ourselves are somebody, and have our own
point of view. So when you two look at each
other, and contemplate your own bliss, you
will be optimists; and when you read the suicides
in the papers, and think of the Siberian
exiles and my labors in Water Street, it will
be the other way. Why, I am often a pessimist
in the morning, and the reverse at night.
It depends on the impression you receive, as
Jim says; and there are a good many impressions,
and not all alike. Often you can be
betwixt and between. Let us fix it that way:
I am sure that ought to suit anybody."</p>

<p>Jim agreed that it would do very well, but
Clarice seemed undecided. "It seems so frivolous
to look at Life in this easy way, just
because we&mdash;well, are not unhappy, and not
without friends. You never do yourself justice,
Robert&mdash;or very rarely. If we have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
favored beyond others, we ought to be earnest
and serious."</p>

<p>"My dear, Time will check your frivolity,
and mitigate the morbid bitterness of Jim's
gloomy contempt of life&mdash;or vice versa. If I
have got you mixed up, I beg pardon: you
have changed positions so, it confuses me.
But as we are to be earnest and serious, we
should seek to communicate our happiness
to others. Hadn't I better call them in?"</p>

<p>The lovers consented, and I called. Mabel
and Jane came with eager smiles and effusive
congratulations. It is curious, the stress which
the feminine intellect lays on a mere point of
time, or external event, like the celebration of
a union between two young people, or the first
statement that such a union is to be formed;
whereas we all know that the real event is
mental, or at most resides in the clash and
concurrence of two minds, assisted by the
bodies they inhabit. Our friends had probably
come to a sufficient understanding the
night of Jim's arrival, a week ago: in fact the
thing was practically settled when I brought
back his submission, and even he must have
had sense enough to know it was when she
wrote him that one word, 'Come.' So what on
earth is the use of making a fuss about it now?
But I will not press this view, which may be
too rarefied and lofty for the vulgar mind.</p>

<p>There were kisses, and laughter, and tears I
believe&mdash;but not of the Princess' shedding&mdash;just
as if something had really happened. I
was sorry for Jim, he looked so sheepish.
Then he, or Clarice, or both of them, to cover
the awkwardness of the moment, began to extol
my virtues and services&mdash;in which there was
no sense at all; for suppose you have done a
good thing, you don't want to be everlastingly
cackling about it: the thing is done, let it
stand on its own merits or demerits. To stop
this, I proposed a division of the honors.
"There is Herbert, who is unhappily in bed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
now: he set the ball rolling. He was the only
one of us all who dared ask Clarice what she
had done to you, Jim. And here is Clarice
herself, who discovered that my health was
failing and needed the air that blows over
troutbrooks; give her a benefit. And here is
Jane, who urged me on&mdash;drove me, I may say.
But for her, I might never have had courage to
beard you two dreadful people, and ask you
what you meant by such conduct."</p>

<p>Jane was receiving due attention, when
Mabel spoke. "You must not overlook me, as
if I had had no hand in it. I approved and
encouraged it from the start: you know I did.
And when you went away, Mr. Hartman, and
they all felt so badly and thought you would
never come back, I always said it would be
right&mdash;<ins class="correction" title="Transcriber's Note - the original reads: always. without quotation marks">always</ins>."</p>
